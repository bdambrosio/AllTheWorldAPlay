Maya: 'A lifetime ago, yes. Days feel different now—like the tide’s shifting but not sure which way yet. My day’s been... quiet, mostly. Filled with thoughts I’m still sorting through.' 
Elijah: 'Sounds heavy, Maya. You know you can tell me what's on your mind, right? I’m here, even if it feels like the tide’s pulling us different ways.'

Elijah: 'I get that. The sea’s never easy to read, and neither are we sometimes. But I’m here, steady, ready to face those currents with you—whatever comes. We’ve got to let what we build take its time, or else it won’t last at all.'
