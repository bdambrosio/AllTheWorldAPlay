Jean: 'Francoise, I ain’t here to waste breath. We both need peace and strong ties. What say you to joining hands, for land and life?' 
Francoise: 'Joining hands sounds wise, but first I must know if your heart is true and steady. Words alone have stirred much doubt.' 
Jean: 'I ain’t blind to doubt, Francoise. My heart’s tied to this land and to makin’ right what’s been broken. I’m no stranger to hard truth—steady enough to stand when the wind blows fierce. You want proof? I’ll show it with work, not just talk.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, see this land I tend with my own hands—no lies in sweat, only truth. This is how I prove my heart steady.' 
Francoise: 'Your hands tend the soil true, Jean. Yet, steady heart must grow in silence too—village eyes watch sharp, and words carry far beyond fields.' 
 
Francoise: 'I see your work speaks true, Jean, but how will you stand with village when whispers turn sharp? We need more than sweat.' 
Jean: 'Sharp whispers don’t scare me, Francoise. I’ll face ‘em head-on, with hard work and clear truth. They’ll see I’m no shadow, but a man who stands firm. This farm, this life, it’s ours to defend—together, if you trust me.' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, I wonder how you’ll bear the weight when village turns cold to us. Will your heart hold steady then?' 
Jean: 'Cold or warm, I stand firm. Village can turn its back, but my heart's tied to this soil and to you. I’m no man to break under weight, Francoise. Together, we’ll bear what comes.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, I know the village eyes and tongues cut deep. But if we stand close, no whisper’ll break us. What terms would ease your heart?' 
Francoise: '(Francoise lowers her gaze briefly, voice steady but soft) The village’s breath is long and harsh. I’ll need more than closeness — clear plans, promises kept, and your word to shield what’s ours. Without that, even close ties can snap under weight.' 
 
Francoise: ...I must weigh Jean’s promises against village whispers and my own hopes—trust grows slow, but clear plans ease the mind....

The village remains calm with ongoing wariness and no resumed communal cooperation at the well.  
 
 
Jean: 'I ain’t here to beg or barter! This land’s blood and sweat of my years—claim it fair or be damned!' 
Father: 'Jean, I hear your fire, but now's no time for ultimatums. This family's future depends on calm, not chaos. We must hold off on any final claims until everyone has a chance to speak.' 
Jean: 'Calm’s for those sittin’ safe and waitin’—but I’m here standin’ for what’s mine. We’ve waited long enough. Let them speak all they want, but I won’t back down till my claim’s clear.' 
Father: 'Jean, I understand your fire, but rushing now will only fracture this family further. We need to hold steady, hear all voices—then act. Let’s not burn bridges before we cross them.' 
Jean: 'Holdin’ back only feeds their doubt and chips at what I’m owed. We wait, they’ll carve the farm without me. I’m not here to mend fences with soft words—I’m here to claim what’s mine. If that fractures the family, so be it.' 
 
Francoise: ...I must weigh words that show my support but keep my name clear of any blame—balance is delicate, trust fragile.... 
 
Jean: 'Father, siblings, hear me well — Francoise and I stand united, our bond a shield for this farm’s future. Deny us, and you deny the land’s true keeper. This alliance is no empty promise, but the bedrock of what’s to come.' 
Father: 'Jean, your words carry fire, but this farm’s future needs steady hands, not just bold vows. We will hear all, but now’s no moment for final pledges.' 
Jean: 'Steady hands won’t keep me waitin’, old man. If bold vows are fire, then let it burn through this stubborn silence. We can’t stand still while they carve the farm in the dark.' 
Father: 'Jean, your fire’s clear, but rushing now fractures more than silence. We need time—justice demands patience, not just bold vows.' 
Jean: 'Patience is fine for those sittin’ quiet, but for me, justice means fightin’ now. Delay is just another way to rob me of what’s mine. I won’t stand still while they carve up our land behind my back.' 
Father: 'Jean, your fire is clear, but rushing now will only splinter what little unity remains. We need to hold back, hear the others fully, and keep this family standing. Patience isn't theft, it's the only way to keep control.' 
 ----scene wrapup: No resolution reached; family tensions deepen; all aware stakes are high.

Francoise: 'Yes, quiet is best. We keep our talks close, away from prying ears. Only then can trust grow without fear.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, meet me by the old barn at the edge o’ the fields—quiet place, no ears to catch our words.'
