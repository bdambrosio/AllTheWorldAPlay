Jean: 'You listen, Francoise! This ground is mine just like yours. We end this now—no more bloody tricks!' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, I know this land is ours as much as yours; the mark’s by the old oak, where my father set it years ago.' 
 
Jean: 'Look, Francoise, this quarrel’s a waste for us both. We settle this with words, not yells.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, I ain’t blind to your pride, but this scrap’s draggin’ us down. We can’t we find some damn middle ground, like decent folk?' 
Francoise: 'Jean, we both understand pride cannot weigh heavy when the fate of our families rests upon this land. I am ready to speak—not as foes, but as neighbors. Let us seek the boundary that is just, even if it requires patience.' 
 
Francoise: ...I must weigh if suggesting a meeting soon will ease Jean’s anger or make him suspect my intents. Better to show openness yet caution.... 
 ----scene wrapup: Neither yields; mistrust deepens but they agree to further talks.

Jean: 'Look here, I bust my back and my grain's damn fine. That blasted mill stoppin' us ain't helpin' no one. We gotta sort a fair price, yeah?' 
Mill2_owner: 'A fair price doesn’t alter the terms. The mill runs only if I permit it. This isn’t about the quality of your grain—it's about who holds the reins. Don’t test my patience, Jean.'

Francoise: 'Jean, if you cast your eyes to the old oak by the stream, you will find the mark my father made—this I do solemnly affirm.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, I'm willin' to talk it through—this land’s gotta bind us, not tear us apart.' 
Francoise: 'Yes, Jean. This is the path we must walk—careful, yet side by side. The dawn will surely bring clearer words between us.'

----- ACT 2 ----- Negotiations and Rising Threats 
 -----scene----- Mill Owner's Veiled Threat
    Setting: Mill2 at 1850-07-16 05:30:00

Francoise: ...I must weigh words careful, to show strength without anger, so Mill2_owner might hear my plea without closing heart.... 
 
Francoise: 'I see you guard the mill well, yet my family’s crops cannot be left to rot. Let us agree on terms that weigh fair for us both, for the sake of all our kin.' 
Mill2_owner: 'Fair terms are mine to decide, not yours to request. If you seek the mill’s goodwill, show me you deserve it—or see your harvest decay.' 
Francoise: 'The value of my family’s work shows in each sheaf we carry to the mill. I ask not for kindness, but for justice—for if the harvest wastes, so too do our dreams. Let us agree on terms that respect the toil of us both.' 
Mill2_owner: 'Justice is a measure I dispense—not a plea you make. Your dreams hold no weight if the mill stays idle by my command. Demonstrate your merit, or witness the harvest wither on the stalk.' 
Francoise: '(leans in just a bit, voice calm but firm) Merit, it is not only the sweat upon my brow but the life we keep in this village. If you hold the mill, you hold the fate of us all. We lose together if the harvest spoils. Let us seek terms that keep the wheel turning—for the good of us both.' 
Mill2_owner: '(narrowing eyes) You speak of fate as though I hold it to bestow. The mill moves only by my command—not out of mercy. Show me your value beyond mere talk, and perhaps the wheel will turn for your sake.' 
Francoise: '(steady gaze, voice measured) I grasp your authority is firm. Yet hear me—my family’s labor and honor carry weight beyond mere speech. I shall show my worth in deed, for all who depend on this soil. We both stand to suffer if the mill remains still.' 
 
Francoise: 'I bring this grain, ripe and true, witness to my family’s honest labor. Let the mill turn for all who earn its service.' 
 
Francoise: does Francoise carries the freshly harvested grain sack steadily to Mill2_owner’s door, presenting it with quiet dignity as proof of her family’s honest labor.

Francoise feels a quiet swell of hope and cautious relief, sensing her family's honest labor begins to sway 
 
Mill2_owner: 'If you want a place here, bring me grain fit to grind, no excuses. Then we’ll speak.' 
 ----scene wrapup: Mill2_owner asserts dominance; Francoise feels pressure mounting but remains resolute.

Jean: 'Francoise, we gotta set this line sharp now—no more foolin' ‘round, so no family’s torn apart later. You with me?' 
Francoise: 'Yes, Jean, today we draw the line straight—no room for whispers to come between us. Let us mark it firm, yet gentle, so no family bears the pain of loss.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, enough with the talk. We’ll measure this out steady, bit by bit, so no one ends up wonderin’.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, I’ll mark this line firm and straight—no one’s gonna be left wonderin’ where your land stops and mine starts. Keep your eyes sharp.' 
 
Francoise: does Francoise gently points to the carved mark on the old oak tree, tracing the line with her finger to emphasize the boundary. Francoise sees the carved boundary mark clearly on the old oak tree. Jean notices her gesture and nods in silent agreement, reaffirming their peaceful understanding.

</end 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, let’s pledge on our family’s name—no sneaky moves, just honest words to hold us fast. You stand with me?' 
Francoise: 'Jean, I stand beside you, yet this honour holds us both firm. Let what we do now bear the weight of our vows, that trust may deepen with each passing day.' 
 
Francoise: ...I must weigh how firm I show trust now, lest Jean think me weak, yet soften enough to bind our fates with hope....

Jean: 'Look, this alliance is like a fragile line stretched tight by storms, but I trust you, and I swear I’ll hold this bond steady with all I got. We face the dangers together.' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, the path before us is thin, yet I place my hope in your steady hand. Together, let us bind our futures with cautious hearts and quiet strength.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, this blockade’s squeezin’ us hard. We need a plan—push together or face ’em headfirst? What do you think?' 
Francoise: 'Jean, we must proceed cautiously. A rash step could undo all we have earned. Let us first discern where their defenses falter, then advance united—calm and deliberate.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, be plain with me—where do you see their line crackin’? We’ll mark it firm, then move steady, careful like.' 
Francoise: 'Jean, their power rests with the mill’s grip. The master's greed blinds him—unease stirs beneath their watch. We must observe where their stores weaken; there, our hope lies. Yet we must advance with care—one false move could ruin us all.' 
 
Francoise: 'Friends, I only ask this—let us keep quiet of stories that bring no good. Our ties must remain strong.'

Jean: 'Listen, I’m tryin’ to find a way to settle this without it turnin’ ugly. What terms would you call fair, then?' 
Mill2_owner: 'Fair terms don’t mean I lose grip. You want the mill turning? Show me you’re worth it, like Francoise—deliver grain that commands respect. Until then, the gates remain shut.' 
 
Mill2_owner: ...If I hold firm now, Jean’s frustration will rise—but that pressure might force him to back down or bargain harder. Maintain blockade, watch for signs of concession or escalation....

Jean: 'Listen, Francoise, I’m set to hold to this agreement, but be clear with me—what dangers do you see us facing for our kin’s sake?' 
Francoise: 'Jean, the peril dwells in watchful eyes and murmuring tongues. The village’s whispers can sever ties more keenly than any sword. We must protect our accord as one would a fragile seed, lest it fail to take root and grow strong.' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, before we join hands, let us vow to shield our names from the village’s murmurs—they wound sharper than any sword.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, I’m dead set on keepin’ this pact, but we gotta spell it out—what’s your price for trust before we seal the deal?' 
Francoise: 'Jean, trust is no treasure to buy, but a bond we build with steady hearts. Let us keep our lips sealed and stand strong against the village’s biting words. Our promise must resist harsh tongues as much as any threat.' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, these whispers spread fast as flame—just one loose word, and all we’ve built could go up in smoke. We must hold close, and speak sparingly of what we intend.'

Jean: 'You hear me, Mill2_owner? This damn blockade’s stranglin’ our harvest. You let it go now, or we’ll tear it down ourselves. What’s your move?' 
Mill2_owner: 'Very well. Half the mill’s capacity, nothing beyond that. The remainder stays locked tight. That’s my decision.' 
 
Mill2_owner: 'Half the mill remains sealed. Your chance comes only when your grain earns its keep—no favors, no shortcuts.' 
 
Jean: 'Open that damn blockade all the way, or I swear on my blood we’ll be tearing it down with our own hands. You got that?' 
 
Jean: 'Half the mill’s movin’, but that’s barely a crack. We’ll grind what we can, but mark my words—we’re watchin’ every inch, and we won’t let this choke go easy.' 
 
Jean: 'I’m not beggin’ here, but half a mill won’t keep our farms breathin’. How ’bout we set a proper schedule so each one gets a fair slice?' 
Mill2_owner: 'Schedules won’t rewrite the rules, Jean. Half the mill stands firm. Bring grain that earns its keep, or don’t hold your breath for more. That’s the bottom line—accept it or walk away.' 
 
Jean: ...If Mill2_owner won’t budge on full access, maybe proposin’ a strict schedule’ll show we mean business but ain’t gonna back down easy — gotta keep pressure firm....
