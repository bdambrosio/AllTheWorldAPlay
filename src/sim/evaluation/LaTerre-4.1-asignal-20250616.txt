Francoise: 'Jean, may I ask... what is it you really hope for in this match? Is it only the farm, or is there something beyond the soil you desire?' 
Jean: 'It’s more than just land I’m fightin’ for, Francoise. I want a future where my sweat and blood don’t just vanish in the dirt. The farm’s part of it, sure, but I know a man’s worth ain’t only in crops. Tell me, do you reckon that too, or is this just some deal to you?' 
Francoise: 'Jean, I understand your struggle runs beneath the earth, but I must tread lightly. Words may hide what is true or spark whispers among the folk. If this match carries weight beyond the land, then prove it—deeds tell more than quiet vows by the mill.' 
Jean: 'Deeds, yes—but what’s a man’s toil worth if no one trusts the words he speaks? I’m willin’ to prove it to you, Francoise, but I can’t take your quiet for honest. If this match means anything, it needs truth bared open, not hid behind locked lips.' 
Francoise: '(sighs, gaze steady) Jean, trust don’t come easy in these parts—not with tongues quick to twist what’s said. If your heart’s set on more than just land, then stand firm beside me when the village looks with wary eyes. Words alone can cut deep if they’re not held with heed.' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, when the village watches with their sharp eyes, I will stand with you—let them know my trust in you is no fleeting shadow.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, I’m not lookin’ for hollow words. If you’re with me now, no matter what the village mouths say, we take on this world side by side. You with me?' 
Francoise: '(nods slowly, voice measured) I stand with you, Jean. But trust... it grows like the first shoots in spring—slow and needing care. We must have more than talk—deeds that hold steady when the village eyes us with doubt. I’m with you, but we tread lightly, oui?' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, the village chatter’s like wind rattlin’ dry stalks—but if we stand our ground, they’ll soon see who’s worth listenin’ to. You ready to face that with me?' 
Francoise: '(nods slow, eyes steady) I am ready, Jean. But holdin’ our ground is more than just meetin’ harsh words—it’s showin’ them we’re real, even when the wind bites sharp. We must be patient and watchful, or this trust might break before it takes hold.' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, I feel what you carry in your heart, but the village’s eyes are sharp and quick to whisper—let us go slow, and keep our footing soft for now.' 
 ----scene wrapup: Both acknowledge mutual interest but remain guarded, unresolved tension simmers.

Jean: 'Let ’em chatter all they want—if any of ’em lay a finger on you, Francoise, I won’t hesitate to shut their mouths with my fists.' 
 
Francoise: 'Jean, if you stand with me for real, then guard not just my name but the quiet truths I keep close to heart.' 
Jean: '(Jean’s gaze sharpens, voice firm) Quiet truths are the hardest to hold, but I’m no man to back down. I’ll guard what’s yours like it’s mine own. But you gotta trust me whole, Francoise—no half measures, no doubt. We stand together, or not at all.' 
 
Jean: 'If we keep our bond hidden, the gossip won’t quit. You ready to stand with me at the market when dawn breaks?' 
Francoise: '(Francoise’s eyes lower to the ground, voice hushed) At first light, I shall be there. But remember, Jean—every step we share must be firm, lest the village’s murmurs harm more than our reputations. We proceed cautiously, but with resolve.' 
 
Jean: 'Francoise, I feel the village stares like knives, but if we stand side by side, their whispers won’t tear us down. I’m with you, come hell or high water.'
