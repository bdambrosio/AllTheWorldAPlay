Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Samantha, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Current Situation: Take stock of surroundings with caution, noting Joe\'s presence and potential resources like Mushrooms#1, Berries#11, and Berries#12, while trying to recall how I ended up here, feeling anxious and curious.\n   Reason: Need to understand environment and context.\n   Actors: [\'Samantha\', \'Joe\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Visibility and terrain fully assessed. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Current Situation: Take stock of surroundings calmly now\n   Reason: Need to know our location better\n   Actors: [\'Joe\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Have noted key visible resources nearby \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Current Situation: Take stock of surroundings calmly now\n   Reason: Need to know our location better\n   Actors: [\'Joe\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Have noted key visible resources nearby \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination?

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Berry Edibility: Check if berries are safe to eat quickly\n   Reason: Need food, ensure berry safety now\n   Actors: [\'Joe\', \'Samantha\']\n    Start time: Right Away;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Berries identified as edible or not \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Berry Edibility: Check if berries are safe to eat quickly\n   Reason: Need food, ensure berry safety now\n   Actors: [\'Joe\', \'Samantha\']\n    Start time: Right Away;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Berries identified as edible or not \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation.

Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Samantha, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Forage for Edible Berries: Check Berries#11 and Berries#12 safety and eat\n   Reason: Need food for immediate survival needs\n   Actors: [\'Samantha\', \'Joe\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:20:00\n    Termination Criterion: Berries safely consumed or deemed unsafe \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

He feels a growing sense of comfort and trust towards her, appreciating her input and concern for their well-being. Recently, their relationship has become more collaborative, with Joe seeking her advice and valuing her presence in their outdoor adventures. Their dynamic remains informal and adaptive, with Joe becoming more communicative and reliant on Samantha.\n\nSamantha says: hey, do you know where we are or how we got here?\nJoe says: No idea, I\'m totally clueless.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Discuss with Samantha: Share findings with her carefully now\n   Reason: We should work together somehow\n   Actors: [\'Joe\', \'Samantha\']\n    Start time: After Assessment;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Have discussed main observations briefly \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

He feels comfortable and trusting towards her, valuing her input and collaboration. Recently, their relationship has become more cooperative, with Joe seeking her advice and relying on her expertise. Their dynamic remains informal and adaptive, with open communication and mutual respect. Joe appreciates Samantha\'s cautious approach, which balances his impulsive nature. Their partnership is strengthening, with a growing sense of interdependence and shared exploration.\n\nSamantha says: "Hey, let\'s check Berries#12 first, it looks bigger and juicier"\nJoe says: Yeah, that one does look good.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Discuss with Samantha: Share findings with her carefully now\n   Reason: We should work together somehow\n   Actors: [\'Joe\', \'Samantha\']\n    Start time: After Assessment;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Have discussed main observations briefly \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

This may invalidate parts of the above:\nDiscuss with Samantha: Share findings with her carefully now \n reason: We should work together somehow \n termination: Have discussed main observations briefly\nvisual: You see Samantha: \'Check Berries#12 for bugs and rot\'\nyou notice \nThe scent of decaying berries at Berries#12 has intensified, and the buzzing of bugs has increased.\n\n\n##\n\n#Recent history\n\n##\n\n#Previous act if any\n\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nVigilant (vigilant, ready, focused), Anxious (worried, uneasy), Observing (gathering social information)\n##\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\n\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Explore North Area: Investigate Mushrooms#1 with caution now\n   Reason: Food and resources are essential urgently\n   Actors: [\'Joe\']\n    Start time: After Discussion;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Have gathered or identified resources there \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

This may invalidate parts of the above:\nAssess Berry Patch Safety: Check Berries#12 for bugs and rot while considering Joe's cautious approach. \n reason: Ensure food safety before consumption now. \n termination: Berries#12 checked for bugs and rot.\nyou notice \nThe scent of decaying berries at Berries#12 has intensified, and the buzzing of bugs has increased.\n\n\nvisual: You see Joe: 'Mushrooms#1'\n##\n\n#Recent history\n\n##\n\n#Previous act if any\n\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\nSamantha's location is now at Berries#12.\nThe presence of bugs and rotting berries is noted at Berries#12 for Samantha.\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Observing (gathering social information)\n##\n\n"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nBerries#12\nBerries#11\nBerries#12\nThicket#1\nThicket#1\nThicket#1\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Samantha, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Test Berry Edibility: Heat test a small Berries#12 sample on a rock with Joe\'s guidance.\n   Reason: Verify edibility before eating the berries.\n   Actors: [\'Samantha\', \'Joe\']\n    Start time: After Assessment;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Heat test result shows no adverse reactions. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]
