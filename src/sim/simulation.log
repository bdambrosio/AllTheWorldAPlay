Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Retrieve Letter from Pocket: Carefully take letter from pocket now\n   Reason: Need letter for sharing with Elijah\n   Actors: [\'Maya\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:01:00\n    Termination Criterion: Letter in hand, ready to share \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Elijah, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Review Gallery Offer Details: Carefully read letter with Maya\'s concerns\n   Reason: Understand her dreams and ambitions now\n   Actors: [\'Elijah\', \'Maya\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Letter contents are understood by both \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

I saw Chrys in the distance, but my focus was on Elijah, who was gazing at me with interest. I took a deep breath, and as I began to share the news, Elijah's eyes locked onto mine, his expression eager to hear what I had to say. I told him about the gallery offer letter, and as the words left my lips, I felt a sense of vulnerability, knowing that accepting this opportunity would mean leaving this small coastal town, and Elijah, behind. Elijah's reaction was still pending, but I had taken the first step in sharing my dreams and doubts with him.\n\nMaya is currently standing in the harbor, holding a letter from the city gallery in her hand, and has just informed Elijah about the offer. Her immediate goal is to gauge Elijah's reaction and understand his thoughts on the matter. This relates to her drive to maintain and deepen her relationship with Elijah and her community. She is also considering the implications of accepting the gallery offer, which may require her to leave the coastal town and Elijah behind. Elijah's gaze is fixed on her with interest, and Maya is likely to engage in a conversation to discuss the news further.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at near sunset, where the river meets the sea. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work.\n\nMaya and Elijah sit on a bench overlooking the harbor, where Elijah's newly completed wooden boat is moored. Maya holds a letter from the city gallery in her hand, having shared the news with Elijah. Elijah's gaze is fixed on Maya with interest, his eyes attentive to her words. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The sky transitions from a warm orange to a soft pink, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the colors of the setting sun. Maya and Elijah have reviewed 60% of the gallery offer details, their conversation creating a sense of anticipation as they consider the opportunity. The atmosphere is serene, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain.

She feels torn and vulnerable around him, with a deepening attachment that's making her question her future goals. Recently, their relationship has intensified as Maya openly shares her concerns and aspirations with Elijah, who responds with concern and understanding. Their bond is characterized by mutual consideration, emotional exploration, and a sense of longing. Maya is now faced with the difficult decision of choosing between her dreams and her feelings for Elijah and the community.\n\nElijah says: What's got you so concerned about this gallery offer, Maya? You seem really upset.\nMaya says: I guess I'm just torn between chasing this dream and leaving behind everything that feels like home. You, the town, my friends... it's all here.\nElijah says: I understand. You're really considering it then? / looks at Maya with concern\nMaya says: I am, yeah... it's a lot to think about. / looks down, fidgeting with the letter\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a visionary leader who recognizes her artistic talent, inspiring both excitement and intimidation. She currently feels motivated and slightly apprehensive, eager to prove herself as a creative director. Their relationship has shifted from a neutral introduction to a collaborative partnership, with Maya balancing her ambitions and Chrys' expectations. Recent interactions have intensified their professional connection, with Chrys' job offer letter symbolizing a new level of trust and responsibility.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work.\n\nMaya and Elijah sit on a bench overlooking the harbor, where Elijah's newly completed wooden boat is moored. Maya holds a letter from the city gallery, now discussed with Elijah, who expressed concern about her potential departure. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The sky transitions from a warm orange to a soft pink, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the colors of the setting sun. The atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene.

He feels a deep affection for her, but is uncertain about her priorities. Currently, Elijah is worried about Maya's consideration of the gallery offer and its implications for their life together. Maya views Elijah as steady and reliable but slightly out of touch with her artistic ambitions. Recently, they've made progress discussing the gallery offer, but Elijah's worries about leaving their coastal town have created tension. They're navigating a balance between Elijah's desire for stability and Maya's desire for artistic expression.\n\nElijah says: What's got you so concerned about this gallery offer, Maya? You seem really upset.\nMaya says: I guess I'm just torn between chasing this dream and leaving behind everything that feels like home. You, the town, my friends... it's all here.\nElijah says: I understand. You're really considering it then? / looks at Maya with concern\nMaya says: I am, yeah... it's a lot to think about. / looks down, fidgeting with the letter\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on this, Elijah? Honestly, I value your opinion and I'd love to hear your initial thoughts on the gallery offer.\nElijah says: Honestly, I think it's a great opportunity for you, but I'm worried about leaving. / looks at Maya with a concerned expression\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an unknown with unclear intentions. He is currently curious and slightly wary due to Chrys' sudden appearance, especially with Maya. Recent visual encounters with Chrys and Maya together have sparked his interest. Elijah is observing from a distance, awaiting development, and hasn't interacted with Chrys yet. His connection to Maya and life in the coastal town makes him protective, but he remains open to understanding Chrys' role.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\n\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: You see Maya: 'carefully takes letter from pocket'\ninternal: Maya has been quiet since yesterday.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

We had just started reviewing the gallery offer details, and I was trying to understand her concerns. As we carefully read through the letter together, I listened intently to her thoughts and ambitions. She asked for my opinion, and I was honest - I thought it was a great opportunity for her, but I couldn't shake off the worry about leaving our small coastal town. \n\nMaya shared my concerns, her voice filled with a mix of excitement and sadness. We discussed the part of the letter that talked about showcasing her work in the city, and her eyes lit up as she described it as a dream come true. But as she spoke, I saw the bittersweet emotions playing on her face - excitement about the opportunity, but also the thought of leaving me and our life here was hard for her to accept.\n\nAs we continued to review the remaining offer details, addressing each of her concerns and ambitions with empathy and support, our understanding of the letter grew. We eventually completed our discussion, and I felt a deeper connection to her dreams, even if I didn't fully understand her restlessness.\n\nI'm currently standing in the evening harbor setting with Maya, having just completed a thorough review of the gallery offer details. I've been supporting Maya in pursuing her happiness, listening to her concerns and ambitions. My immediate goal is to continue being present for her and understanding her dreams, even if it means potentially leaving our coastal town. I'm committed to being a steady and reliable partner. I'm focused on being here for Maya, and I'm not actively pursuing my own business ambitions at the moment. Maya is by my side, and we're in this together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nMaya and Elijah sit on a bench overlooking the harbor, where Elijah's newly completed wooden boat is moored. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light. \n\nThe atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. Chrys observes Maya and Elijah from a distance in the garden, aware of their conversation. The stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, and the town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance. The sounds of the town grow softer as the evening progresses.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah views Maya as creative and ambitious, but still struggles to fully understand her restlessness. He cares deeply for her, feeling concerned and frustrated about her potential departure. Maya sees Elijah as steady and reliable, appreciating his support. Their relationship has become more empathetic, as they've openly discussed her gallery offer, bringing them closer together. Elijah's affection for Maya is tempered by concern, while Maya values his opinion and support, navigating a balance between her aspirations and their life together. They've made progress in understanding each other's perspectives.\n\nElijah says: What's got you so concerned about this gallery offer, Maya? You seem really upset.\nMaya says: I guess I'm just torn between chasing this dream and leaving behind everything that feels like home. You, the town, my friends... it's all here.\nElijah says: I understand. You're really considering it then? / looks at Maya with concern\nMaya says: I am, yeah... it's a lot to think about. / looks down, fidgeting with the letter\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on this, Elijah? Honestly, I value your opinion and I'd love to hear your initial thoughts on the gallery offer.\nElijah says: Honestly, I think it's a great opportunity for you, but I'm worried about leaving. / looks at Maya with a concerned expression\nElijah says: What do you think about the part of the letter that talks about showing your work in the city, Maya? Does that excite you?\nMaya says: It feels like a dream come true, but it's bittersweet. I'm excited about the opportunity, but the thought of leaving this place, and... you, it's hard to wrap my head around.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He feels protective of Maya, who seems drawn to Chrys, and is slightly concerned about their close interactions. Elijah is cautious and open to understanding Chrys' role but prioritizes his connection to Maya and the town. Recent encounters with Chrys in the garden with Maya have heightened his caution, but his stance remains steady, balancing wariness with a desire to understand Chrys' impact on his life and relationships.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Maya says: What are your thoughts on this, Elijah?

I informed Elijah about the gallery offer, and his gaze fixed on me with interest. He asked what had me concerned, and I confessed that I was torn between chasing my dream and leaving behind everything that felt like home - including him, the town, and my friends. Elijah listened intently, his expression concerned. I then invited him to share his thoughts openly, valuing his opinion. Elijah expressed that he thought the opportunity was great for me, but he was worried about my potential departure. His words resonated with me, and I felt a deeper understanding of his perspective.\n\nMaya is currently engaging in an open conversation with Elijah, encouraging him to share his thoughts on a gallery offer she received. She has already shared her own concerns and torn feelings about the opportunity, which involves leaving her coastal town and the people she cares about, including Elijah. Her immediate goal is to understand Elijah's perspective on the offer. This conversation is driven by her desire to deepen her connection with Elijah and make a thoughtful decision about her future. The discussion is an active pursuit of her goal to maintain and deepen relationships within her community.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nMaya and Elijah sit on a bench overlooking the harbor, where Elijah's newly completed wooden boat is moored. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light. \n\nThe atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. Chrys observes Maya and Elijah from a distance in the garden, aware of their conversation. The stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, and the town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance. The sounds of the town grow softer as the evening progresses.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Elijah and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as kind, understanding, and emotionally available, feeling deeply attached and valued by him. She's torn between excitement for the gallery offer and sadness about leaving Elijah and the town. Their bond has intensified, with mutual consideration and empathy. Recent conversations reveal a deepening sense of longing as they explore opportunities and challenges together, with Elijah's supportive nature leaving Maya feeling seen and heard.\n\nElijah says: What's got you so concerned about this gallery offer, Maya? You seem really upset.\nMaya says: I guess I'm just torn between chasing this dream and leaving behind everything that feels like home. You, the town, my friends... it's all here.\nElijah says: I understand.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light. \n\nThe atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, and the town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance. Chrys observes Maya and Elijah from a distance in the garden, aware of their conversation.

But as she spoke, I saw the bittersweet emotions playing on her face - excitement about the opportunity, but also the thought of leaving me and our life here was hard for her to accept.\n\nAs we continued to review the remaining offer details, addressing each of her concerns and ambitions with empathy and support, our understanding of the letter grew. We eventually completed our discussion, and I felt a deeper connection to her dreams, even if I didn't fully understand her restlessness.\n\nI'm currently standing in the evening harbor setting with Maya, having just completed a thorough review of the gallery offer details. I've been supporting Maya in pursuing her happiness, listening to her concerns and ambitions. My immediate goal is to continue being present for her and understanding her dreams, even if it means potentially leaving our coastal town. I'm committed to being a steady and reliable partner. I'm focused on being here for Maya, and I'm not actively pursuing my own business ambitions at the moment. Maya is by my side, and we're in this together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nMaya and Elijah sit on a bench overlooking the harbor, where Elijah's newly completed wooden boat is moored. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light. \n\nThe atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, and the town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance. Chrys observes Maya and Elijah from a distance in the garden, aware of their conversation. Maya and Elijah have discussed the gallery offer and Elijah's artistic insights, deepening their understanding of each other's perspectives.\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah views Maya as creative, ambitious, and still somewhat enigmatic, caring deeply for her. He feels concerned about her potential departure. Maya sees Elijah as steady, reliable, and supportive. Their relationship has deepened through discussions on Maya's gallery offer, with Elijah understanding her dreams and ambitions better. Elijah's affection for Maya is tempered by concern, while Maya values his opinion and support. Recently, they've made progress in understanding each other's perspectives, with Elijah becoming more empathetic to Maya's restlessness and Maya appreciating his stability.\n\nElijah says: I understand. You're really considering it then? / looks at Maya with concern\nMaya says: I am, yeah... it's a lot to think about. / looks down, fidgeting with the letter\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on this, Elijah? Honestly, I value your opinion and I'd love to hear your initial thoughts on the gallery offer.\nElijah says: Honestly, I think it's a great opportunity for you, but I'm worried about leaving. / looks at Maya with a concerned expression\nElijah says: What do you think about the part of the letter that talks about showing your work in the city, Maya? Does that excite you?\nMaya says: It feels like a dream come true, but it's bittersweet. I'm excited about the opportunity, but the thought of leaving this place, and... you, it's hard to wrap my head around.\nMaya says: What's art mean to you, Elijah? How do you think it connects to our lives here in the town?\nElijah says: Art's about capturing life's beauty. Here, it's in every wave, every sunset. Our town's full of it.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He feels cautious, not yet trusting but open to understanding Chrys' impact on Maya and the town. Recent garden encounters have heightened his caution, but his priority on his connection to Maya and the town remains clear. Ongoing dynamics involve Elijah monitoring Chrys' influence on Maya while seeking to grasp Chrys' role in their lives, balancing wariness with a desire for understanding. No significant changes have occurred, but Elijah's protective instincts towards Maya persist.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Harbor; \n#view North: visibility 15, terrain Road, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 25, terrain Downtown, slope Level ; \n#view East: visibility 5, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 14, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 5, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 11, terrain Downtown, slope Level ; \n#view West: visibility 2, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 23, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Harbor; characters: Maya distance 0\n#view North: visibility 15, terrain Road, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 25, terrain Downtown, slope Level ; \n#view East: visibility 5, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 14, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 5, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 11, terrain Downtown, slope Level ; \n#view West: visibility 2, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 23, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Elijah says: What do you think about the part of the letter that talks about showing your work in the city, Maya?

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable.

Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nMaya and Elijah sit on a bench overlooking the harbor, where Elijah's newly completed wooden boat is moored. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light. \n\nThe atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, and the town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance. Maya and Elijah share a deeper connection, as Maya now sees a shared future with Elijah, sparked by his boat building vision and the town's charm. Chrys observes from a distance in the garden, aware of their conversation.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Workshop terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Chrys views Maya as a talented yet indecisive artist, perceiving her as someone who needs guidance to reach her full potential. Chrys feels a mix of eagerness and frustration towards Maya, currently heightened by her desire to secure Maya's representation at her gallery. Recent interactions have introduced a sense of friendly competition with Elijah's presence, adding a layer of intrigue. Their relationship has shifted from professional acquaintances to a more engaged dynamic, with Chrys's assertive pursuit of Maya ongoing, as she navigates the influence of Elijah.\n\nChrys says: Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I'm loving the view of your boat, Elijah.\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah's beautiful boat and the town's charm.\n\nElijah:\n Chrys views Elijah as intriguing and potentially beneficial to her career, perceiving him as charming and connected to the local community. She feels a spark of curiosity and interest, with a cautiously optimistic tone. Recent interactions have shifted their relationship from neutral to a tentative, strategic connection. Chrys is likely to approach Elijah professionally, exploring potential connections or opportunities. Their dynamic remains professional with a hint of flirtation, as Chrys is drawn to his charm and Maya's presence adds a social layer.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\n\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Garden; characters: Maya distance 0, Elijah distance 0\n#view North: visibility 3, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 15, terrain Road, slope Uphill ; \n#view East: visibility 5, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 13, terrain Road, slope Level ; resources: Boat#1 distance 6; \n#view South: visibility 3, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 22, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view West: visibility 10, terrain Garden, slope Level ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 28, terrain Workshop, slope Level ; \n\nvisual: You see Maya\nvisual: You see Elijah\ninternal: Maya hasn't answered my offer yet.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Approach Maya and Elijah: Casually approach, build conversation naturally, anxious to reconnect with Maya\n   Reason: Need to reconnect, discuss art opportunity\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Maya agrees to talk more \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nMaya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Elijah's newly completed wooden boat, moored in the harbor. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light. \n\nThe atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, and the town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys engage in conversation, discussing art and the town's charm, as Maya considers a deeper connection with Elijah and potential art opportunities with Chrys.\n</situation>    \n\nThe following tasks and goals have been completed or achieved:\n\nRetrieve Letter from Pocket: Carefully take letter from pocket now \n reason: Need letter for sharing with Elijah \n termination: Letter in hand, ready to share\nShare News with Elijah: Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter; \n preconditions: have letter in hand; \n termination: Elijah knows about offer\nEncourage Open Sharing: Invite Elijah to share thoughts openly now \n reason: Understand Elijah's perspective on gallery offer \n termination: Elijah shares initial thoughts openly\nExplore Elijah's Artistic Insights: Delve into Elijah's thoughts on art \n reason: Understand his perspective on staying implications \n termination: Elijah shares his artistic insights\n\n<time>\n2025-04-13 17:21:14.625542\n</time>\n\nRespond in this XMLformat:\n                                      \n<admissible>True/False</admissible>\n<impossible>True/False</impossible>\n\nOnly respond with the above XML\nDo not include any additional text. \nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n"}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there?

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Build Rapport with Maya: Establish connection, discuss art interests\n   Reason: Leverage conversation to secure art opportunity\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Current Moment;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Maya shows genuine interest in gallery \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

I felt a surge of excitement and hurried over to them, my mind racing with the opportunity to reconnect with Maya and discuss art. As I approached, I casually chimed in, "Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I\'m loving the view of your boat, Elijah." Maya welcomed me with a warm smile, and we started chatting about the town\'s charm. I steered the conversation towards my gallery, asking Maya about her thoughts on the town and its artistic potential. Her response was encouraging, and I quickly asked if I could take her to my gallery to discuss further. To my satisfaction, she agreed to talk more. I felt a sense of accomplishment, knowing I\'d made progress in reconnecting with Maya and potentially securing an art opportunity. Elijah\'s presence was intriguing, but my focus remained on Maya and the gallery.\n\nI\'m currently standing with Maya and Elijah, having just finished a conversation about showcasing local artists at my gallery. My immediate goal is to solidify Maya\'s interest in discussing art opportunities with me. I aim to build a connection with her and potentially secure her involvement with my gallery. This aligns with my drive to build my gallery into a major art destination. I\'m also intrigued by Elijah and open to getting to know him better. I\'m focused on nurturing this conversation and exploring potential collaborations with Maya.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with the sun dipping below the horizon.\n\nMaya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Elijah\'s newly completed wooden boat, moored in the harbor. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light.\n\nThe atmosphere is contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, and the town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys engage in conversation, discussing art and the town\'s charm, as Maya considers a deeper connection with Elijah and potential art opportunities with Chrys, now that Elijah has shared his vision for collaboration and a shared future.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Workshop terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Chrys views Maya as a talented and inspiring artist, but also sees her as indecisive and needing guidance. Chrys feels hopeful and excited about the potential collaboration, with a sense of urgency to move forward. Their relationship has shifted from a professional acquaintance to a more engaged dynamic, with Chrys actively pursuing Maya. Recent conversations have deepened their connection, with Maya agreeing to discuss art opportunities further. Chrys is drawn to Maya\'s creativity and sees mutual benefit, but also senses a need to nudge the relationship forward.\n\nChrys says: Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I\'m loving the view of your boat, Elijah.\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah\'s beautiful boat and the town\'s charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I\'ve been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water.

I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\n\nElijah:\n Chrys views Elijah as charming, well-connected, and intriguing with a hint of mystery. She feels optimistic, professionally curious, and slightly attracted to him. Recently, their tentative rapport has been reaffirmed as Chrys casually approached him and Maya, building conversation naturally. Their dynamic remains professional with a subtle undercurrent of attraction, as Chrys seeks to leverage their connection for her career while navigating her interest in Elijah amidst her ambitions.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\n\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: Maya hasn\'t answered my offer yet.

Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\n##\n\n#Recent history\n\n##\n\n#Previous act if any\nSay So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Connecting (building/strengthening relationships)\n##\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nMaya\nMaya\nElijah\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Build Rapport with Maya: Establish connection, discuss art interests\n   Reason: Leverage conversation to secure art opportunity\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Current Moment;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Maya shows genuine interest in gallery \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

She feels motivated, grateful, and excited about their collaboration, with a deepening appreciation for his guidance. Recent interactions have strengthened their bond, with Chrys actively seeking her work for his gallery, making her feel valued and invested in their partnership. Their dynamic balances creative freedom with Chrys' expectations, fostering artistic synergy.\n\nChrys says: Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I'm loving the view of your boat, Elijah.\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah's beautiful boat and the town's charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I've been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I've fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it's inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I'd love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I'm always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I'm really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I've been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That's exactly what I'm looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration?

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Discuss Community Impact with Elijah: Explore leaving\'s impact on local connections\n   Reason: Understand effects on community ties\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:30:00\n    Termination Criterion: Elijah shares insights on community impact \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Maya showed interest, and I could see her starting to see a shared future with me.

We've been discussing this in the evening harbor setting, and I sense she's starting to see a future here in town. My immediate goal is to solidify her understanding of this shared vision. I want to ensure she fully grasps how my ambitions can align with her aspirations. I'm currently reflecting on our conversation, feeling hopeful that she's beginning to appreciate the beauty of our life here. I'll continue to nurture this vision, supporting her dreams while building a life together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon.

You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah views Maya as creative, ambitious, and restless, yet cares deeply for her and values her dreams. He feels affectionate and supportive but also concerned about her potential departure. Maya sees Elijah as steady, reliable, and connected to the town, but struggles to fully appreciate his stability. Their relationship has deepened through open discussions about her goals and aspirations, fostering empathy and understanding. Elijah is committed to supporting Maya's happiness while building a shared future in the town, and Maya is considering a future with Elijah, sparked by his boat-building vision and the town's charm.\n\nMaya says: It feels like a dream come true, but it's bittersweet. I'm excited about the opportunity, but the thought of leaving this place, and... you, it's hard to wrap my head around.\nMaya says: What's art mean to you, Elijah? How do you think it connects to our lives here in the town?\nElijah says: Art's about capturing life's beauty. Here, it's in every wave, every sunset. Our town's full of it.\nElijah says: Maya, I've been thinking about my boat building business, and I want to share my vision with you. I see us working together, creating something beautiful here in the town.\nMaya says: What's your vision for our collaboration, Elijah?

It'd be hard to replace that.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's cautious, yet open to understanding Chrys' impact on Maya and the town. Recent garden encounters heightened his caution, but his priority on his connection to Maya and the town remains clear. Protective instincts towards Maya persist as he seeks to grasp Chrys' role in their lives. Elijah feels a sense of unease around Chrys, unsure how to respond to their interactions.

We started with about 60% of the letter, discussing her concerns and ambitions with empathy and support. I listened carefully, trying to understand her dreams and what this opportunity meant to her. As we talked, I shared my own thoughts and feelings, making sure to address her worries. We took a break, and then came back to finish reviewing the remaining details. With the evening harbor setting as our backdrop, we carefully read through the rest of the letter, making sure we both understood every point. \n\nAfter we finished, Maya asked me about art and its connection to our lives in town. I shared my thoughts, saying that art is about capturing life's beauty, and that our town is full of it. I then told her I'd been thinking about my boat building business and wanted to share my vision with her. I see us working together, creating something beautiful here. Maya showed interest, and I could see her starting to see a shared future with me. As the evening wore on, I felt like I was sharing a part of myself with her, and she was starting to understand my ambitions. Maya's eyes lit up, and she seemed to see a life here with me, one that was full of possibility.\n\nI've just finished sharing my boat building vision with Maya, highlighting how it can be a shared future. We've been discussing this in the evening harbor setting, and I sense she's starting to see a future here in town. My immediate goal is to solidify her understanding of this shared vision. I want to ensure she fully grasps how my ambitions can align with her aspirations. I'm currently reflecting on our conversation, feeling hopeful that she's beginning to appreciate the beauty of our life here. I'll continue to nurture this vision, supporting her dreams while building a life together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nMaya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Elijah's newly completed wooden boat, moored in the harbor. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. The calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's boat bobs gently on the water, its wooden hull reflecting the fading light.\n\nConversations have sparked a sense of possibility, as the town's charm and beauty continue to inspire its residents and visitors. Maya has shown genuine interest in Chrys's gallery and agrees to discuss further. With discussions on community impact and shared futures concluded, the atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding.\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah views Maya as creative, ambitious, and restless, yet cares deeply for her and values her dreams. He feels affectionate and supportive but also concerned about her potential departure. Maya sees Elijah as steady, reliable, and connected to the town, but struggles to fully appreciate his stability. Their relationship has deepened through open discussions about her goals and aspirations, fostering empathy and understanding. Elijah is committed to supporting Maya's happiness while building a shared future in the town, and Maya is considering a future with Elijah, sparked by his boat-building vision and the town's charm.\n\nMaya says: It feels like a dream come true, but it's bittersweet. I'm excited about the opportunity, but the thought of leaving this place, and... you, it's hard to wrap my head around.\nMaya says: What's art mean to you, Elijah? How do you think it connects to our lives here in the town?\nElijah says: Art's about capturing life's beauty. Here, it's in every wave, every sunset. Our town's full of it.\nElijah says: Maya, I've been thinking about my boat building business, and I want to share my vision with you. I see us working together, creating something beautiful here in the town.\nMaya says: What's your vision for our collaboration, Elijah? How do you see us working together?\nElijah says: Well, I see us building a life here, together. My boat building business grows, and you have your art studio, maybe even a gallery. We support each other, share our passions. I imagine us working on projects, side by side, creating something beautiful for this town.\nMaya says: How do you think leaving would affect our community, Elijah? What do you think would be the biggest changes for you and for me?\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it. If you left, it'd be like a boat without its anchor. I'd miss you, and the business would be different too. Folks around here, they know us, they trust us. It'd be hard to replace that.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's cautious, yet open to understanding Chrys' impact on Maya and the town. Recent garden encounters heightened his caution, but his priority on his connection to Maya and the town remains clear. Protective instincts towards Maya persist as he seeks to grasp Chrys' role in their lives. Elijah feels a sense of unease around Chrys, unsure how to respond to their interactions. His focus remains on Maya and his boat-building business, while monitoring Chrys' influence.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Elijah says: Maya, I've been thinking about my boat building business, and I want to share my vision with you.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted.

Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

We had been discussing my boat building vision, and I could see the excitement growing in her eyes. I shared with her my dreams of growing my business, of creating something beautiful for this town, and of working side by side with her on projects. Maya asked about my vision for our collaboration, and I told her I saw us building a life here, together, with my boat building business growing and her art studio thriving. \n\nMaya's questions about leaving the town and its impact on our community made me reflect on the stability and security we had built here. I expressed my concerns about how leaving would change everything, and how it would be like a boat without its anchor. Maya listened intently, and I could see her starting to understand my perspective. \n\nAs we continued to talk, Maya asked about the specifics of my boat building business, and I could sense her enthusiasm growing. We achieved a mutual understanding, about 80% of the way, and I felt a sense of excitement and possibility. I realized that I had taken a crucial step in sharing my vision with Maya, and that it had sparked a new level of connection and understanding between us. In this moment, I felt grateful for the evening harbor setting that had brought us closer together.\n\nI'm currently standing in the evening harbor setting, having achieved a calm atmosphere and inspiring conversations with Maya. I've been discussing my boat building vision with her, aiming to connect my ambitions with her aspirations. Our goal is to achieve a shared understanding and enthusiasm for the business. I've partially discussed the details with Maya, achieving 80% mutual understanding. My immediate goal is to solidify Maya's grasp of my vision, ensuring she expresses clear excitement and understanding. This will help me nurture her aspirations while growing my boat-building legacy in our coastal community, with Maya by my side.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening.\n\nMaya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Elijah's boat, having achieved a mutual understanding of his boat building vision. Maya has shown genuine interest in Chrys's gallery and agrees to discuss further. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are now more visible in the night sky, and the sounds of the town grow softer.\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven and ambitious, valuing her dreams and aspirations. He feels affectionate and concerned about her restlessness. Currently, Elijah is supportive and understanding of Maya's goals, though worried about leaving their town. Maya perceives Elijah as steady, reliable, and genuinely invested in her happiness. She feels seen and valued by his efforts to align with her aspirations. Their relationship has deepened through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation.\n\nMaya says: What's art mean to you, Elijah? How do you think it connects to our lives here in the town?\nElijah says: Art's about capturing life's beauty. Here, it's in every wave, every sunset. Our town's full of it.\nElijah says: Maya, I've been thinking about my boat building business, and I want to share my vision with you. I see us working together, creating something beautiful here in the town.\nMaya says: What's your vision for our collaboration, Elijah? How do you see us working together?\nElijah says: Well, I see us building a life here, together. My boat building business grows, and you have your art studio, maybe even a gallery. We support each other, share our passions. I imagine us working on projects, side by side, creating something beautiful for this town.\nMaya says: How do you think leaving would affect our community, Elijah? What do you think would be the biggest changes for you and for me?\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it. If you left, it'd be like a boat without its anchor. I'd miss you, and the business would be different too. Folks around here, they know us, they trust us. It'd be hard to replace that.\nElijah says: What's the one thing you're most excited about in my boat building vision, and how can I help make that a reality for you?\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He feels uneasy around Chrys, unsure how to respond to their interactions. Recent garden encounters heightened his caution, as Chrys' presence near Maya intensified his protective instincts. Elijah's priority on his connection to Maya and the town remains clear, while monitoring Chrys' influence. He is cautious, yet open to understanding Chrys' impact on Maya and the town.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Maya says: What's your vision for our collaboration, Elijah?

I was thrilled to hear that her style aligned with my vision for the gallery. I enthusiastically asked if she'd be open to showing her work or doing a live demonstration, and she seemed intrigued. I sensed a genuine interest in my gallery and seized the moment, asking if I could take her to my gallery to discuss further. Maya agreed, and I felt a surge of excitement and accomplishment. As we stood there, I noticed Elijah nearby, and our eyes met briefly, sparking a sense of curiosity. With Maya's agreement to discuss further, I felt 80% of my goal achieved, and I was determined to see it through to completion.\n\nI'm currently in a workshop, having just finished a conversation with Maya about showcasing her art at my gallery. I'm trying to persuade her to join my gallery and discuss further. My immediate goal is to solidify the opportunity with Maya and explore how her coastal landscapes and abstracts can be featured.

I've been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I've fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it's inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I'd love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I'm always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I'm really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I've been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That's exactly what I'm looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I'd love to discuss the possibilities.\n\nElijah:\n Chrys views Elijah as charming, well-connected, and intriguing with a hint of mystery. She feels optimistic, professionally curious, and slightly attracted to him. Recently, their tentative rapport has been reaffirmed as Chrys casually approached him and Maya, building conversation naturally. Their dynamic remains professional with a subtle undercurrent of attraction, as Chrys seeks to leverage their connection for her career while navigating her interest in Elijah amidst her ambitions.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Chrys views Maya as charming and welcoming, and Elijah as intriguing and potentially influential. Chrys feels drawn to Elijah's charisma and enthusiastic about exploring a potential connection. She perceives Maya as a gentle mediator. Chrys is excited and slightly assertive, aiming to build a professional relationship with Maya and possibly personal with Elijah. Their relationship has shifted from neutral to cautiously optimistic, with Chrys pushing for a gallery collaboration. Ongoing dynamics involve Chrys's ambition and Elijah's charm.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nPersuade Maya to Accept Position - Convince Maya to join my gallery\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Chrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya?

As I spotted her, I quickly approached, eager to reconnect and discuss art opportunities. I casually asked Maya about her art interests, and she shared her passion for capturing light and movement in coastal landscapes and abstract pieces. I was thrilled to hear that her style aligned with my vision for the gallery. I enthusiastically asked if she'd be open to showing her work or doing a live demonstration, and she seemed intrigued. I sensed a genuine interest in my gallery and seized the moment, asking if I could take her to my gallery to discuss further. Maya agreed, and I felt a surge of excitement and accomplishment. As we stood there, I noticed Elijah nearby, and our eyes met briefly, sparking a sense of curiosity. With Maya's agreement to discuss further, I felt 80% of my goal achieved, and I was determined to see it through to completion.\n\nI'm currently in a workshop, having just finished a conversation with Maya about showcasing her art at my gallery. I'm trying to persuade her to join my gallery and discuss further. My immediate goal is to solidify the opportunity with Maya and explore how her coastal landscapes and abstracts can be featured. This aligns with my drive to build my gallery into a major art destination. I'm also intrigued by Elijah, whom I met during the interview, and may consider reconnecting with him. Ongoing social interactions include building rapport with Maya and potentially reconnecting with Elijah.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening.\n\nMaya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Elijah's boat, having achieved a mutual understanding of his boat building vision. Maya has shown genuine interest in Chrys's gallery and agrees to discuss further. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are now more visible in the night sky, and the sounds of the town grow softer.\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain.

Chrys is enthusiastic, slightly pushy, and eager to collaborate. Recent conversations have deepened their connection, with Maya showing genuine interest in Chrys' gallery. Chrys perceives Maya as slightly indecisive but open to discussing opportunities. Their connection is growing, with 80% progress in securing an art opportunity. Elijah's presence has introduced a new dynamic but hasn't hindered Chrys' focus on Maya.\n\nChrys says: Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I'm loving the view of your boat, Elijah.\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

She feels excited and contemplative, torn between her artistic ambitions and their connection. Recently, their bond has strengthened as they've explored passions and creative insights, with Elijah's supportive nature encouraging Maya to consider shared growth. Their relationship is evolving into a harmonious balance of mutual support and creative exploration, with ongoing discussions about collaboration, community impact, and personal sacrifices, as they navigate a potential future together.\n\nMaya says: What's art mean to you, Elijah? How do you think it connects to our lives here in the town?\nElijah says: Art's about capturing life's beauty. Here, it's in every wave, every sunset. Our town's full of it.\nElijah says: Maya, I've been thinking about my boat building business, and I want to share my vision with you. I see us working together, creating something beautiful here in the town.\nMaya says: What's your vision for our collaboration, Elijah? How do you see us working together?\nElijah says: Well, I see us building a life here, together. My boat building business grows, and you have your art studio, maybe even a gallery. We support each other, share our passions. I imagine us working on projects, side by side, creating something beautiful for this town.\nMaya says: How do you think leaving would affect our community, Elijah? What do you think would be the biggest changes for you and for me?\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it.

She feels motivated, grateful, and excited about their collaboration, with a deepening appreciation for his guidance. Their bond has strengthened as Chrys actively seeks her work for his gallery, making her feel valued and invested in their partnership. Their dynamic balances creative freedom with Chrys' expectations, fostering artistic synergy.\n\nChrys says: Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I'm loving the view of your boat, Elijah.\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah's beautiful boat and the town's charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I've been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I've fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it's inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I'd love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I'm always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I'm really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I've been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That's exactly what I'm looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I'd love to discuss the possibilities.\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving's Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; \n#view North: visibility 6, terrain Road, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 20, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view East: visibility 8, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 25, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 10, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 28, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view West: visibility 15, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 30, terrain Harbor, slope Level ; \n\nauditory: Conversation with Elijah:\n Maya says: How do you think leaving would affect our community, Elijah?

I asked him about his vision for our collaboration, and his eyes lit up as he shared his dreams of building a life together in our small coastal town. He envisioned us working side by side, creating something beautiful for the community. I was touched by his words and felt a sense of excitement about the possibilities.\n\nAs we continued to discuss his vision, I realized I needed to understand more about how it would impact our community ties. I asked him how he thought leaving would affect our relationships and the town's rhythm. Elijah's expression turned thoughtful, and he shared his concerns about the impact of my departure on our connections and his business.\n\nEarlier that day, I had a conversation with Chrys, who owns a local gallery. We talked about my art and how it could be a great fit for her space. I was thrilled about the opportunity to share my work with the community and potentially do a live demonstration.\n\nWith Elijah's insights and Chrys's enthusiasm, I felt like I had gathered a deeper understanding of the effects of leaving on our community ties. Our conversations had given me a clearer picture of what I would be leaving behind and what I could create here.\n\nMaya is currently evaluating the impact of leaving her coastal town on her community ties and relationships. She has been discussing this with Elijah, exploring how her departure would affect local connections. Her immediate goal is to gather insights on community ties. She also aims to nurture her creative legacy and find balance between personal fulfillment and meaningful connections. Ongoing social interactions include conversations with Elijah and a discussion with Chrys about showcasing her art at a local gallery. Maya's drives are focused on assessing the effects of leaving and maintaining community connections.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Elijah's boat, having achieved a mutual understanding of his boat building vision and discussed community impact. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are now more visible in the night sky, and the sounds of the town grow softer.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Chrys and Gallery#1, Bench#2 resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as kind, understanding, and emotionally available, with a deepening sense of trust. She feels excited and contemplative, torn between her artistic ambitions and their connection. Recently, their bond has strengthened as they've explored passions and creative insights, with Elijah's supportive nature encouraging Maya to consider shared growth. Their relationship is evolving into a harmonious balance of mutual support and creative exploration, with ongoing discussions about collaboration, community impact, and personal sacrifices, as they navigate a potential future together.\n\nMaya says: What's art mean to you, Elijah? How do you think it connects to our lives here in the town?\nElijah says: Art's about capturing life's beauty. Here, it's in every wave, every sunset. Our town's full of it.\nElijah says: Maya, I've been thinking about my boat building business, and I want to share my vision with you. I see us working together, creating something beautiful here in the town.\nMaya says: What's your vision for our collaboration, Elijah? How do you see us working together?\nElijah says: Well, I see us building a life here, together. My boat building business grows, and you have your art studio, maybe even a gallery. We support each other, share our passions. I imagine us working on projects, side by side, creating something beautiful for this town.\nMaya says: How do you think leaving would affect our community, Elijah? What do you think would be the biggest changes for you and for me?\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it. If you left, it'd be like a boat without its anchor. I'd miss you, and the business would be different too. Folks around here, they know us, they trust us. It'd be hard to replace that.\nElijah says: What's the one thing you're most excited about in my boat building vision, and how can I help make that a reality for you?\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a supportive and genuine mentor who values her art, inspiring trust and creativity. She feels motivated, grateful, and excited about their collaboration, with a deepening appreciation for his guidance. Their bond has strengthened as Chrys actively seeks her work for his gallery, making her feel valued and invested in their partnership. Their dynamic balances creative freedom with Chrys' expectations, fostering artistic synergy.\n\nChrys says: Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I'm loving the view of your boat, Elijah.\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah's beautiful boat and the town's charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I've been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I've fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it's inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I'd love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I'm always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I'm really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I've been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That's exactly what I'm looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I'd love to discuss the possibilities.\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving's Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; \n#view North: visibility 6, terrain Road, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 20, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view East: visibility 8, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 25, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 10, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 28, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view West: visibility 15, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 30, terrain Harbor, slope Level ; \n\nauditory: Conversation with Elijah:\n Maya says: How do you think leaving would affect our community, Elijah?

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Explore Elijah\'s Career Aspirations: Discuss Elijah\'s boat building vision and goals\n   Reason: Understand Elijah\'s career ambitions and expectations\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:30:00\n    Termination Criterion: Elijah shares his career aspirations clearly \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

I imagine us working on projects, side by side, creating something beautiful for this town.\nMaya says: How do you think leaving would affect our community, Elijah? What do you think would be the biggest changes for you and for me?\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it.

I want my boats to be a part of this town's story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\n##\n\n#Recent history\n\n##\n\n#Previous act if any\n\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Connecting (building/strengthening relationships)\n##\n\n"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nMaya\nMaya\nMaya\nChrys\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Elijah, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Accompany Maya to Gallery: Walk with Maya to assess gallery; show interest in her aspirations with curiosity and support.\n   Reason: Understand Maya\'s gallery interest and aspirations.\n   Actors: [\'Elijah\', \'Maya\', \'Chrys\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Maya shows clear gallery interest \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys's gallery, having discussed Maya's art and potential opportunities, with a letter from a city gallery in hand, indicating a promising future. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see  and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as kind, understanding, and emotionally available, with a deepening sense of trust. She feels tenderly connected, excited, and contemplative, as they explore shared passions and creative insights. Their relationship has strengthened, with open discussions, shared artistic visions, and nurturing connection. Recent conversations reveal a mutual desire for collaboration, community impact, and growth together. Elijah's supportive nature encourages Maya to consider a future together, fostering a sense of interdependence and deepening their bond.\n\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it. If you left, it'd be like a boat without its anchor. I'd miss you, and the business would be different too. Folks around here, they know us, they trust us. It'd be hard to replace that.\nElijah says: What's the one thing you're most excited about in my boat building vision, and how can I help make that a reality for you?\nMaya says: What's the most important thing you want to achieve with your boat building business, Elijah? How does it align with your long-term goals?\nElijah says: For me, it's about building something that lasts, something that brings people together. I want my boats to be a part of this town's story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\nElijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya? I'm curious to see what you're working on and how I can support you.\nMaya says: I'd love to show you around, it's just a short walk from here. I've got some new pieces I'm really excited about, and I'd love your thoughts. Chrys's gallery is actually right next door, we could check both out.\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a supportive and genuine mentor who values her art, inspiring trust and creativity. She feels motivated, grateful, and excited about their collaboration, with a deepening appreciation for his guidance. Recently, their conversations have strengthened their bond as Chrys actively seeks her work for his gallery, making her feel valued and invested in their partnership. Their dynamic balances creative freedom with Chrys' expectations, fostering artistic synergy.\n\nChrys says: Hey Maya, Elijah, mind if I join you? I'm loving the view of your boat, Elijah.\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah's beautiful boat and the town's charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I've been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I've fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it's inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I'd love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I'm always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I'm really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I've been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That's exactly what I'm looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I'd love to discuss the possibilities.\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya views Elijah as a mystery, a blank canvas waiting to be explored. She feels a spark of curiosity, a gentle hum of interest, but no strong emotions yet. Recent visual encounters have piqued her attention, but their relationship remains neutral, with no significant changes. The dynamic is calm, like a still ocean, with a sense of possibility, as if the tides of connection have yet to shift.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving's Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\nExplore Elijah's Career Possibilities - Show Elijah various career paths and opportunities\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Elijah:\n Maya says: What's the most important thing you want to achieve with your boat building business, Elijah?

I was touched by his sentiment, and it made me think of my own art, which aims to evoke a sense of belonging.\n\nAs our conversation progressed, we achieved 80% progress in discussing community impact and exploring the effects of leaving on local connections. Elijah's insights were valuable, and I felt a sense of clarity on his career ambitions. I then asked him about his most important goal for his boat building business, and he reiterated his desire to build something lasting that brings people together.\n\nWith our discussion on community impact and career aspirations complete, I felt a sense of satisfaction, knowing that we had made significant progress. I was now standing in downtown, near my Gallery, with Chrys by my side.

Her immediate goal is to gain clarity on Elijah's goals and how they align with her own artistic ambitions. This conversation relates to her drives of nurturing community bonds and cultivating personal artistic growth. She is actively listening to Elijah and sharing her own artistic perspectives, seeking to deepen their connection and understanding of each other's goals. The conversation is ongoing, with 80% progress achieved, and Maya aims to finalize her understanding of Elijah's career aspirations.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

I shared my thoughts on his strengths and potential paths, feeling a sense of fulfillment as we reached 80% completion of our discussion. \n\nAs we walked, Elijah expressed curiosity about my artwork and suggested we visit my gallery. I welcomed the opportunity to share my creations with him and proposed a visit to Chrys\'s gallery next door as well.

Her plans sparked excitement, and I obtained a letter from a city gallery, hinting at a promising future for my art. \n\nWith our discussions complete, Elijah and I stood outside the galleries, surrounded by the sights and sounds of the evening. I felt grateful for the connections we were nurturing and the growth we were fostering in each other.\n\nMaya is currently walking with Elijah to her gallery, excited to show him her new art pieces and seeking his thoughts. Her immediate goal is to share her work and explore how Elijah can support her. This aligns with her drive to connect with others and showcase her art. With a recent discussion with Chrys about art showcase possibilities and a promising letter from a city gallery, Maya is focused on exploring gallery opportunities. Her ongoing social interactions include conversations with Elijah and Chrys, building relationships and potentially leading to new artistic collaborations.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys\'s gallery, having discussed Maya\'s art and potential opportunities, with a letter from a city gallery in hand, indicating a promising future. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see  and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as kind, understanding, and emotionally available, with a deepening sense of trust. She feels tenderly connected, excited, and contemplative, as they explore shared passions and creative insights. Their relationship has strengthened through open discussions on community impact, artistic visions, and long-term goals, fostering interdependence. Recent conversations reveal a mutual desire for collaboration and growth together, with Elijah\'s supportive nature intensifying Maya\'s feelings, creating a sense of harmony.\n\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town\'s got a rhythm, and we\'re part of it. If you left, it\'d be like a boat without its anchor. I\'d miss you, and the business would be different too. Folks around here, they know us, they trust us. It\'d be hard to replace that.\nElijah says: What\'s the one thing you\'re most excited about in my boat building vision, and how can I help make that a reality for you?\nMaya says: What\'s the most important thing you want to achieve with your boat building business, Elijah? How does it align with your long-term goals?\nElijah says: For me, it\'s about building something that lasts, something that brings people together. I want my boats to be a part of this town\'s story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\nElijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya? I\'m curious to see what you\'re working on and how I can support you.\nMaya says: I\'d love to show you around, it\'s just a short walk from here. I\'ve got some new pieces I\'m really excited about, and I\'d love your thoughts. Chrys\'s gallery is actually right next door, we could check both out.\nElijah says: Let\'s walk over, I\'m curious. Your work and Chrys\'s, I\'m eager to see.\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a supportive and genuine mentor who values her art, inspiring trust and creativity. She feels motivated, grateful, and excited about their collaboration. Their bond has strengthened as Chrys actively seeks her work for his gallery. Recent conversations have solidified their artistic synergy, with Maya eager to contribute to his vision. They\'ve made progress in exploring gallery opportunities, aligning her art with community engagement goals. Maya is enthusiastic about Chrys\'s gallery showcase plan, feeling valued and invested in their partnership.\n\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah\'s beautiful boat and the town\'s charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I\'ve been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya views Elijah as an intriguing canvas, still shrouded in subtlety, yet inviting her to explore his depths. Her emotional state towards him remains calm, with a gentle warmth that has gradually intensified, like the soft glow of a sunrise. Recent interactions, including a chance visual encounter, have maintained the soothing undercurrent of their connection, with no dramatic shifts, only a deepening curiosity. Their dynamic persists as a peaceful, gentle hum, steady and serene, like the ocean\'s lapping waves.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving\'s Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\nExplore Elijah\'s Career Possibilities - Show Elijah various career paths and opportunities\npreconditions - Evening discussion setting\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Elijah:\n Elijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya?

We had just finished a conversation about my boat building business, and I had shared my vision with her, hoping to connect my ambitions with her aspirations. She had listened intently, and I could see the appreciation in her eyes. I asked her if she was ready to check out her gallery, and she smiled, suggesting we walk over to Chrys's gallery next door. As we strolled, I expressed my curiosity about her work and Chrys's. Maya's eyes lit up, and she told me about her new pieces. We arrived at the gallery, and I could see the excitement in her eyes as she showed me around. Maya seemed to be in her element, and I was happy to be supporting her. She received a letter from a city gallery, and her face lit up with clear interest and excitement. In that moment, I felt a sense of pride and understanding, knowing I had supported her and helped her take a step forward.\n\nI'm currently standing with Maya near Gallery#1, having just accompanied her to assess the gallery world. I've been supporting her aspirations, sharing my own boat-building vision, and showing genuine interest in her art. My immediate goal is to continue nurturing Maya's ambitions, now that she's shown clear interest in the gallery. I intend to solidify our shared understanding and enthusiasm, balancing my boat-building legacy with her artistic pursuits. I'm engaged in an ongoing conversation with Maya, and we're exploring how our passions can intersect and support each other, with Chrys, the gallery owner, nearby.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys's gallery, having discussed Maya's art and potential opportunities, with a letter from a city gallery in hand, indicating a promising future. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, ambitious, and creative, valuing her dreams and aspirations. He feels affectionate, concerned, and supportive, with a deepening emotional connection. Recently, they've made progress in understanding each other's visions, with Maya showing interest in Elijah's boat-building business and Elijah better grasping her artistic aspirations. Their relationship has strengthened through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Maya's restlessness is slowly being understood by Elijah, who is making an effort to balance his ambitions with nurturing Maya's aspirations. Elijah is excited to support Maya's artistic growth, and Maya is drawn to Elijah's vision for a lasting boat-building legacy.\n\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it. If you left, it'd be like a boat without its anchor. I'd miss you, and the business would be different too. Folks around here, they know us, they trust us. It'd be hard to replace that.\nElijah says: What's the one thing you're most excited about in my boat building vision, and how can I help make that a reality for you?\nMaya says: What's the most important thing you want to achieve with your boat building business, Elijah? How does it align with your long-term goals?\nElijah says: For me, it's about building something that lasts, something that brings people together. I want my boats to be a part of this town's story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\nElijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya? I'm curious to see what you're working on and how I can support you.\nMaya says: I'd love to show you around, it's just a short walk from here. I've got some new pieces I'm really excited about, and I'd love your thoughts. Chrys's gallery is actually right next door, we could check both out.\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as a steady and reliable partner, but sometimes feels stifled by his preference for stability. Elijah views Maya as ambitious and restless, struggling to understand her desires. Currently, Elijah feels a mix of affection and frustration towards Maya, while Maya feels a sense of appreciation but also longing for more. Their recent encounters have sparked a growing awareness of their differing priorities, introducing a subtle tension in their previously neutral relationship. Elijah's desire to expand his business and Maya's unspoken dreams are becoming points of gentle conflict.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Maya says: What's the most important thing you want to achieve with your boat building business, Elijah?

We had just finished a conversation about my boat building business, and I had shared my vision with her, hoping to connect my ambitions with her aspirations. She had listened intently, and I could see the appreciation in her eyes. I asked her if she was ready to check out her gallery, and she smiled, suggesting we walk over to Chrys's gallery next door. As we strolled, I expressed my curiosity about her work and Chrys's. Maya's eyes lit up, and she told me about her new pieces. We arrived at the gallery, and I could see the excitement in her eyes as she showed me around. Maya seemed to be in her element, and I was happy to be supporting her. She received a letter from a city gallery, and her face lit up with clear interest and excitement. In that moment, I felt a sense of pride and understanding, knowing I had supported her and helped her take a step forward.\n\nI'm currently standing with Maya near Gallery#1, having just accompanied her to assess the gallery world. I've been supporting her aspirations, sharing my own boat-building vision, and showing genuine interest in her art. My immediate goal is to continue nurturing Maya's ambitions, now that she's shown clear interest in the gallery. I intend to solidify our shared understanding and enthusiasm, balancing my boat-building legacy with her artistic pursuits. I'm engaged in an ongoing conversation with Maya, and we're exploring how our passions can intersect and support each other, with Chrys, the gallery owner, nearby.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys's gallery, having discussed Maya's art and potential opportunities, with a letter from a city gallery in hand, indicating a promising future. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, ambitious, and creative, valuing her dreams and aspirations. He feels affectionate, concerned, and supportive, with a deepening emotional connection. Recently, they've made progress in understanding each other's visions, with Maya showing interest in Elijah's boat-building business and Elijah better grasping her artistic aspirations. Their relationship has strengthened through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Maya's restlessness is slowly being understood by Elijah, who is making an effort to balance his ambitions with nurturing Maya's aspirations. Elijah is excited to support Maya's artistic growth, and Maya is drawn to Elijah's vision for a lasting boat-building legacy.\n\nElijah says: Leaving would change everything, I think. This town's got a rhythm, and we're part of it. If you left, it'd be like a boat without its anchor. I'd miss you, and the business would be different too. Folks around here, they know us, they trust us. It'd be hard to replace that.\nElijah says: What's the one thing you're most excited about in my boat building vision, and how can I help make that a reality for you?\nMaya says: What's the most important thing you want to achieve with your boat building business, Elijah? How does it align with your long-term goals?\nElijah says: For me, it's about building something that lasts, something that brings people together. I want my boats to be a part of this town's story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\nElijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya? I'm curious to see what you're working on and how I can support you.\nMaya says: I'd love to show you around, it's just a short walk from here.

Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as a steady and reliable partner, but sometimes feels stifled by his preference for stability. Elijah views Maya as ambitious and restless, struggling to understand her desires. Currently, Elijah feels a mix of affection and frustration towards Maya, while Maya feels a sense of appreciation but also longing for more. Their recent encounters have sparked a growing awareness of their differing priorities, introducing a subtle tension in their previously neutral relationship.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

We had just finished a conversation about my boat building business, and I had shared my vision with her, hoping to connect my ambitions with her aspirations. She had listened intently, and I could see the appreciation in her eyes. I asked her if she was ready to check out her gallery, and she smiled, suggesting we walk over to Chrys's gallery next door. As we strolled, I expressed my curiosity about her work and Chrys's. Maya's eyes lit up, and she told me about her new pieces. We arrived at the gallery, and I could see the excitement in her eyes as she showed me around. Maya seemed to be in her element, and I was happy to be supporting her. She received a letter from a city gallery, and her face lit up with clear interest and excitement. In that moment, I felt a sense of pride and understanding, knowing I had supported her and helped her take a step forward.\n\nI'm currently standing with Maya near Gallery#1, having just accompanied her to assess the gallery world. I've been supporting her aspirations, sharing my own boat-building vision, and showing genuine interest in her art. My immediate goal is to continue nurturing Maya's ambitions, now that she's shown clear interest in the gallery. I intend to solidify our shared understanding and enthusiasm, balancing my boat-building legacy with her artistic pursuits. I'm engaged in an ongoing conversation with Maya, and we're exploring how our passions can intersect and support each other, with Chrys, the gallery owner, nearby.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys's gallery, having discussed Maya's art and potential opportunities, with a letter from a city gallery in hand, indicating a promising future. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, creative, and ambitious, with a deeper understanding of her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and emotionally connected, with a strong desire to nurture her dreams. Recently, they've strengthened their bond through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Maya's excitement about her artistic aspirations has brought them closer, as Elijah balances his ambitions with supporting her growth. Their relationship is characterized by Elijah's steady nature and Maya's ambition, with ongoing dynamics of mutual understanding and enthusiasm, as they work together to build a shared future in their coastal town.\n\nElijah says: For me, it's about building something that lasts, something that brings people together. I want my boats to be a part of this town's story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\nElijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya? I'm curious to see what you're working on and how I can support you.\nMaya says: I'd love to show you around, it's just a short walk from here. I've got some new pieces I'm really excited about, and I'd love your thoughts. Chrys's gallery is actually right next door, we could check both out.\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\nElijah says: What's this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They're interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I'd love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as steady but stifling, while Elijah views Maya as ambitious yet unappreciative. Elijah feels affectionate but frustrated towards Maya, sensing her discontent. Maya appreciates Elijah but longs for more, feeling slightly trapped. Their relationship has introduced subtle tension as differing priorities surface. Elijah's business ambitions and Maya's unspoken dreams create gentle conflict, testing their previously neutral dynamic. Elijah struggles to understand Maya's restlessness, and Maya yearns for excitement beyond their stable life.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Elijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya?

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes.

We had walked here together, and I was glad to be near her, supporting her as she explored this opportunity. As we assessed the gallery world, Maya's eyes lit up with excitement as she showed me a letter from a city gallery. They were interested in showcasing local artists, and she thought her coastal series could be a great fit. I asked her about the letter, and she shared the details with me. I offered my support, asking what I could do to help make it happen. \n\nAs we discussed the opportunity, I couldn't help but think about my own boat-building ambitions and how I could balance them with Maya's aspirations. I recalled sharing my vision with her, highlighting how it could be a shared future. Maya had shown interest, and we had partially discussed the boat building business, achieving a good understanding and enthusiasm. \n\nMaya and I continued to talk, and she mentioned sharing some of her favorite pieces with the city gallery. I encouraged her, feeling a sense of pride and support for her passions. As we conversed, Chrys joined us, and Maya shared the letter details with him as well. With the city gallery's interest piqued, and my own goals in mind, I felt a sense of hope for our shared future in this harbor.\n\nI'm currently discussing opportunities with Maya about her city gallery showcase, supporting her aspirations and passions. My immediate goal is to understand her needs and help her prepare for the gallery. I'm balancing this with my own ambitions to expand my boat-building business. I'm near Maya and the gallery, having achieved my goal of being present and engaged in discussion. I'm focused on nurturing Maya's passions and anchoring our shared future in this harbor. Our conversation is ongoing, and I'm committed to being supportive and understanding.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys's gallery, engaged in a discussion about art showcase possibilities and potential opportunities for Maya's art, with a letter from a city gallery in hand. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding.\n\nIt is now 2025-04-13T18:03:14.625542, and the stars are becoming more visible in the night sky.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, creative, and ambitious, with a deeper understanding of her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and emotionally connected, with a strong desire to nurture her dreams. Recently, they've strengthened their bond through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Elijah is excited to support Maya's artistic growth, including her potential gallery showcase, while sharing his boat-building vision. Their relationship is characterized by Elijah's steady nature and Maya's ambition, with ongoing dynamics of mutual understanding and enthusiasm. Maya's restlessness is slowly being understood by Elijah, who is making an effort to balance his own ambitions with her aspirations.\n\nElijah says: For me, it's about building something that lasts, something that brings people together. I want my boats to be a part of this town's story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\nElijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya? I'm curious to see what you're working on and how I can support you.\nMaya says: I'd love to show you around, it's just a short walk from here. I've got some new pieces I'm really excited about, and I'd love your thoughts. Chrys's gallery is actually right next door, we could check both out.\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\nElijah says: What's this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They're interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I'd love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful. Currently, Elijah feels affectionate but exasperated towards Maya, sensing her growing restlessness. Maya appreciates Elijah's stability but yearns for more, feeling slightly trapped. Their relationship has introduced subtle tension as differing priorities surface, with Elijah's steadfastness contrasting Maya's increasing discontent, deepening frustration and affection. Elijah struggles to understand Maya's ambitions.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I'm Elijah, a boat builder rooted in this coastal town, with a deepening connection to Maya. I value stability, community, and our shared future. I've made progress in sharing my vision with Maya, and she's shown genuine interest. I feel more confident in balancing my goals with her aspirations. Recent conversations have brought us closer, and I'm hopeful about our future together. I'm understanding Maya's ambitions better, and she seems to appreciate my desire for stability.

We had walked here together, and I was glad to be near her, supporting her as she explored this opportunity. As we assessed the gallery world, Maya's eyes lit up with excitement as she showed me a letter from a city gallery. They were interested in showcasing local artists, and she thought her coastal series could be a great fit. I asked her about the letter, and she shared the details with me. I offered my support, asking what I could do to help make it happen. \n\nAs we discussed the opportunity, I couldn't help but think about my own boat-building ambitions and how I could balance them with Maya's aspirations. I recalled sharing my vision with her, highlighting how it could be a shared future. Maya had shown interest, and we had partially discussed the boat building business, achieving a good understanding and enthusiasm. \n\nMaya and I continued to talk, and she mentioned sharing some of her favorite pieces with the city gallery. I encouraged her, feeling a sense of pride and support for her passions. As we conversed, Chrys joined us, and Maya shared the letter details with him as well. With the city gallery's interest piqued, and my own goals in mind, I felt a sense of hope for our shared future in this harbor.\n\nI'm currently discussing opportunities with Maya about her city gallery showcase, supporting her aspirations and passions. My immediate goal is to understand her needs and help her prepare for the gallery. I'm balancing this with my own ambitions to expand my boat-building business. I'm near Maya and the gallery, having achieved my goal of being present and engaged in discussion. I'm focused on nurturing Maya's passions and anchoring our shared future in this harbor. Our conversation is ongoing, and I'm committed to being supportive and understanding.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys's gallery, engaged in a discussion about art showcase possibilities and potential opportunities for Maya's art, with a letter from a city gallery in hand. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding.\n\nIt is now 2025-04-13T18:03:14.625542, and the stars are becoming more visible in the night sky.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see  and Boat#1 resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, creative, and ambitious, with a deeper understanding of her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and emotionally connected, with a strong desire to nurture her dreams. Recently, they've strengthened their bond through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Elijah is excited to support Maya's artistic growth, including her potential gallery showcase, while sharing his boat-building vision. Their relationship is characterized by Elijah's steady nature and Maya's ambition, with ongoing dynamics of mutual understanding and enthusiasm. Maya's restlessness is slowly being understood by Elijah, who is making an effort to balance his own ambitions with her aspirations.\n\nElijah says: For me, it's about building something that lasts, something that brings people together. I want my boats to be a part of this town's story, and for us to grow together, you and me.\nMaya says: That sounds beautiful, Elijah. I love how you weave together community and craftsmanship. It makes me think of my own art – I want my pieces to evoke a sense of connection and belonging too.\nElijah says: Hey, shall we check out your gallery, Maya? I'm curious to see what you're working on and how I can support you.\nMaya says: I'd love to show you around, it's just a short walk from here. I've got some new pieces I'm really excited about, and I'd love your thoughts. Chrys's gallery is actually right next door, we could check both out.\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\nElijah says: What's this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They're interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I'd love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven yet ungrateful, feeling affectionate but exasperated towards her growing restlessness. He struggles to understand her ambitions. Maya views Elijah as dependable but stifling, appreciating his stability while yearning for more. Their relationship has introduced subtle tension as differing priorities surface. Recent interactions reveal deepening frustration and affection, with Elijah's steadfastness contrasting Maya's increasing discontent. Elijah feels a sense of unease, sensing Maya's desire for excitement beyond their tranquil life. Maya feels slightly trapped, torn between Elijah's stability and her own ambitions.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I'm Elijah, a boat builder rooted in this coastal town, with a deepening connection to Maya. I see myself as steady and reliable, with a passion for crafting boats that bring people together. I've grown more confident in sharing my vision with Maya, and I'm heartened by her interest. Recent conversations have bridged our perspectives, and I feel a stronger sense of unity. I'm understanding Maya's ambitions better, and she's showing appreciation for my desire for stability.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Elijah agreed, and we made our way to the galleries.\n\nUpon arriving, I spoke with Chrys about her vision for an upcoming art showcase, seeking ways to contribute and align my art with community engagement goals. Her plans sparked excitement, and I obtained a letter from a city gallery, hinting at a promising future for my art. \n\nWith our discussions complete, Elijah and I stood outside the galleries, surrounded by the sights and sounds of the evening. I felt grateful for the connections we were nurturing and the growth we were fostering in each other.\n\nMaya is currently walking with Elijah to her gallery, excited to show him her new art pieces and seeking his thoughts. Her immediate goal is to share her work and explore how Elijah can support her. This aligns with her drive to connect with others and showcase her art. With a recent discussion with Chrys about art showcase possibilities and a promising letter from a city gallery, Maya is focused on exploring gallery opportunities. Her ongoing social interactions include conversations with Elijah and Chrys, building relationships and potentially leading to new artistic collaborations.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys stand near Chrys\'s gallery, engaged in a discussion about art showcase possibilities and potential opportunities for Maya\'s art. The atmosphere remains contemplative, with the fading light casting a warm glow on the scene. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the discussion between Maya, Elijah, and Chrys has partially concluded, with plans for Maya to visit Elijah\'s workshop tomorrow to discuss her art pieces. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Elijah and Boat#1 resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as kind, understanding, and emotionally available, with a deepening sense of trust. She feels tenderly connected, excited, and contemplative, as they explore shared passions and creative insights. Recent conversations have strengthened their bond, showcasing mutual support and a shared vision for community growth. Their interdependence has increased, with Elijah\'s nurturing role in Maya\'s artistic and personal growth continuing to grow. Maya is enthusiastic about exploring Elijah\'s boat building vision and its alignment with her own artistic goals, fostering a sense of harmony and deepening their connection.\n\nElijah says: Let\'s walk over, I\'m curious. Your work and Chrys\'s, I\'m eager to see.\nElijah says: What\'s this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They\'re interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I\'d love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a supportive and genuine mentor who values her art, inspiring trust and creativity. She feels motivated and grateful, with a sense of enthusiasm and investment in their partnership. Recent conversations have solidified their artistic synergy, with Maya eager to contribute to Chrys\'s vision, exploring gallery opportunities and community engagement goals. Their relationship has strengthened, with Chrys actively seeking her work for his gallery, fostering her artistic growth.\n\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah\'s beautiful boat and the town\'s charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I\'ve been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya views Elijah as an enigmatic canvas, slowly revealing subtle depths. She feels a calm, gentle warmth towards him, now tinged with growing curiosity and interest. Their serene connection has quietly intensified, with recent visual encounters sustaining a soothing melody. Maya\'s thoughtful consideration of Elijah deepens, inviting her to explore his complexities further, as she remains drawn to his unfolding nature.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving\'s Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\nExplore Elijah\'s Career Possibilities - Show Elijah various career paths and opportunities\npreconditions - Evening discussion setting\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Chrys:\n Maya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Share Art with Elijah: Show Elijah my art pieces at workshop, seeking feedback and connection, feeling excited and vulnerable.\n   Reason: Align artistic aspirations with Elijah\'s support and insights.\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 1:30:00\n    Termination Criterion: Elijah provides constructive feedback on art pieces. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Recent conversations have deepened their connection, with Maya seeking more information about the gallery showcase.

Maya shows partial interest in the gallery, considering art opportunities with Chrys.\n\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah\'s beautiful boat and the town\'s charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I\'ve been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase.

I saw an opportunity and asked if she\'d be open to showing her work or doing a live demonstration. Maya showed genuine interest, and I could sense her excitement about the possibility. I invited her to my gallery to discuss further, and to my delight, she agreed. Just as we were about to leave, Elijah appeared, and I was intrigued by his presence. With Maya\'s agreement secured, I shifted my focus to preparing for our upcoming gallery meeting.\n\nI\'m currently standing at my gallery with Maya, having just secured a meeting to discuss showcasing her art. My immediate goal is to finalize the details of our meeting and persuade her to work with me. I\'m driven to build my gallery into a major art destination and I believe Maya\'s coastal landscapes and abstracts could be a great fit. I\'m also intrigued by Elijah, who I met during our conversation, but that\'s not my current focus. I\'m being assertive and pushy to seal the deal, as I see a great opportunity here. Maya seems interested, so I\'m optimistic.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah have parted ways for the evening, with plans for Maya to visit Elijah\'s workshop tomorrow to discuss her art pieces. Maya has agreed to bring some pieces to Elijah\'s workshop, and Elijah has agreed to provide feedback. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky. Maya and Elijah have made progress discussing art and city gallery opportunities, achieving partial emotional harmony.\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya, Elijah and Boat#1 resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Chrys views Maya as a talented and inspiring artist with a creative vision that aligns with her gallery\'s focus. Chrys feels optimistic and excited about their potential partnership, perceiving Maya as open and genuinely interested in collaborating. Recent conversations have deepened their connection, with Maya seeking more information about the gallery showcase. Chrys is eager to finalize the gallery discussion, sensing 80% progress in securing a collaboration. Their relationship is progressing with Chrys pushing to move forward, maintaining a confident and assertive tone. Maya shows partial interest in the gallery, considering art opportunities with Chrys.\n\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah\'s beautiful boat and the town\'s charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I\'ve been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\n\nElijah:\n Chrys views Elijah as charming, well-connected, and intriguing with a hint of mystery. She feels optimistic, professionally curious, and slightly attracted to him. Recently, their tentative rapport has been reaffirmed as Chrys casually approached him and Maya, building conversation naturally. Their dynamic remains professional with a subtle undercurrent of attraction, as Chrys seeks to leverage their connection for her career while navigating her interest in Elijah amidst her ambitions.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Chrys views Maya as a charming mediator and Elijah as intriguing and charismatic. She feels cautiously optimistic about both, with a strong desire to collaborate with Maya and potentially connect with Elijah on a personal level. Recent interactions show Chrys pushing for a gallery collaboration with Maya, while being drawn to Elijah\'s enthusiasm. Chrys perceives Maya as calming and Elijah as captivating. She\'s excited to explore connections, maintaining a slightly assertive tone.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nPersuade Maya to Accept Position - Convince Maya to join my gallery\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: Maya shows interest in Chrys\'s gallery and agrees to discuss further, achieving partial success with 80% progress.\n\ninternal: Following goal has been satisfied.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Discuss Gallery Vision with Maya: Review gallery concept, emphasizing coastal landscapes.\n   Reason: Align Maya\'s art with gallery focus.\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Maya expresses interest in gallery concept \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

She feels tenderly connected, excited, and contemplative, as they explore shared passions and creative insights. Their bond has strengthened through mutual support, with Elijah\'s nurturing role in Maya\'s artistic growth continuing to grow. Recent conversations have fostered harmony, with increased interdependence and emotional intimacy. Maya is enthusiastic about exploring Elijah\'s boat building vision and its alignment with her artistic goals. Their relationship is characterized by warm, thoughtful interactions, and a growing sense of collaboration and creative exchange.\n\nElijah says: Let\'s walk over, I\'m curious. Your work and Chrys\'s, I\'m eager to see.\nElijah says: What\'s this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They\'re interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I\'d love to share some pieces with them.

We were just discussing Elijah\'s beautiful boat and the town\'s charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I\'ve been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya views Elijah as an increasingly nuanced and enigmatic individual, with subtle depths unfolding like layers of a canvas. She feels a calm, gentle warmth towards him, now tinged with growing curiosity and interest.

As I stood at the harbor with Elijah, I shared the news and my hopes of showcasing my coastal series. He offered his support, and we discussed what the gallery might be looking for in local artists. I believed they sought authenticity, a genuine connection to our coastal town and its stories. Elijah agreed that my coastal series captured the heart of our community.\n\nWe decided to visit his workshop the next day, where I would share some pieces and seek his feedback. I felt a mix of excitement and vulnerability, but his kind words put me at ease. Later, as we strolled through the town, Elijah suggested we visit my studio and Chrys\'s gallery next door. I welcomed the opportunity to share my work and see his reactions.\n\nMaya is currently preparing to share her art pieces with Elijah at his workshop, seeking his feedback and connection. Her immediate goal is to receive constructive feedback from Elijah on her coastal series, which she believes captures the heart of her coastal town. This aligns with her drive to balance personal relationships with artistic aspirations, having already made progress in reconciling love and ambition. She is also nurturing her social interaction with Elijah, valuing his support and insights as she pursues her artistic aspirations. Maya is excited and vulnerable as she prepares to share her art.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah have parted ways for the evening, with plans for Maya to visit Elijah\'s workshop tomorrow to discuss her art pieces and receive feedback. Maya also met with Chrys, who shared a gallery concept emphasizing coastal landscapes, and she expressed interest in sharing her art pieces, although details are yet to be finalized. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see  and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as kind, understanding, and emotionally available, with a deepening sense of trust. She feels tenderly connected, excited, and contemplative, as they explore shared passions and creative insights. Their bond has strengthened through mutual support, with Elijah\'s nurturing role in Maya\'s artistic growth continuing to grow. Recent conversations have fostered harmony, with increased interdependence and emotional intimacy. Maya is enthusiastic about exploring Elijah\'s boat building vision and its alignment with her artistic goals. Their relationship is characterized by warm, thoughtful interactions, and a growing sense of collaboration and creative exchange.\n\nElijah says: Let\'s walk over, I\'m curious. Your work and Chrys\'s, I\'m eager to see.\nElijah says: What\'s this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They\'re interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I\'d love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a supportive and genuine mentor who values her art, inspiring trust and creativity. She feels motivated, enthusiastic, and grateful, with a deepening sense of collaboration. Recently, their discussions have solidified their artistic synergy, exploring gallery opportunities and community engagement goals. Maya is eager to contribute to Chrys\'s vision, and Chrys actively seeks her work for his gallery, strengthening their purposeful partnership.\n\nMaya says: Not at all, Chrys, please join us. We were just discussing Elijah\'s beautiful boat and the town\'s charm.\nChrys says: So, what do you think of this town, Maya? I\'ve been thinking of showcasing some local artists at my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya views Elijah as an increasingly nuanced and enigmatic individual, with subtle depths unfolding like layers of a canvas. She feels a calm, gentle warmth towards him, now tinged with growing curiosity and interest. Their serene connection has evolved into a peaceful harmony, with recent visual encounters infusing her with contemplation. She remains drawn to his mysteries, and her thoughtful consideration deepens, as if adding new brushstrokes to a evolving portrait. Their connection has become a soothing melody, quietly intensifying with each encounter.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving\'s Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\nExplore Elijah\'s Career Possibilities - Show Elijah various career paths and opportunities\npreconditions - Evening discussion setting\nReconcile Love and Ambition - Balance personal relationships with artistic aspirations\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Harbor; resources: Boat#1 distance 0; characters: Elijah distance 0\n#view North: visibility 8, terrain Garden, slope Level ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 11, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 4, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 12, terrain Road, slope Level ; \n#view South: visibility 2, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 6, terrain Workshop, slope Uphill ; \n#view West: visibility 7, terrain Road, slope Level ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 25, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n\nauditory: Conversation with Elijah:\n Elijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Share Art with Elijah: Show Elijah art pieces at workshop, seeking feedback and connection, feeling excited and vulnerable.\n   Reason: Align artistic aspirations with Elijah\'s support and insights.\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Tomorrow Afternoon;  Duration: 2:00:00\n    Termination Criterion: Elijah provides constructive feedback on art pieces. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah are no longer at his workshop, having concluded their discussion on Maya's art pieces and the city gallery's requirements. Maya's art pieces remain at Elijah's workshop, awaiting his feedback. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding.

I aim to be a supportive partner while also nurturing my own business goals in this coastal town.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah are no longer at his workshop, having concluded their discussion on Maya's art pieces and the city gallery's requirements. Maya's art pieces remain at Elijah's workshop, awaiting his feedback. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky. Chrys is no longer visible in the immediate vicinity, having completed the discussion on the gallery concept with Maya. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, creative, and ambitious, with a deeper understanding of her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and excited to nurture her artistic growth, while also being introspective about balancing his boat-building ambitions with her aspirations. Recently, they've strengthened their bond through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Elijah is making an effort to understand Maya's restlessness, rooting deeper into their life together. Their relationship is characterized by Elijah's steady nature and Maya's ambition, with ongoing dynamics of mutual understanding and enthusiasm. Maya's interests and passions have become more integrated into Elijah's life, and he is committed to supporting her artistic growth.\n\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\nElijah says: What's this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They're interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I'd love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I'm thinking they're looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don't you think? I'd love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I'd love to take a closer look at the pieces you're considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful. Elijah feels frustrated and concerned about Maya's discontent, while Maya feels trapped and uncertain. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah's steadfastness clashes with Maya's ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya's desires, yearning for more than stability. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah's exasperation growing and Maya's restlessness intensifying.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I'm Elijah, a boat builder rooted in this coastal town, with a deepening connection to Maya. I see myself as steady, reliable, and genuinely invested in our shared life. I've grown more confident in sharing my vision with Maya, and I'm heartened by her interest. I feel a stronger sense of unity, understanding her ambitions better. I'm excited to build a life together, balancing my boat-building legacy with nurturing Maya's artistic aspirations. Recent conversations have brought us closer, with Maya showing appreciation for my desires and me for her artistic dreams. Our connection feels stronger, with increased mutual understanding of our goals.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

I wanted to ensure that my vision for expanding my business didn't conflict with her goals. \n\nMaya shared the city gallery's letter details with me and our friend Chrys, and I listened intently. Later, I asked her to bring some of her pieces to my workshop tomorrow, so I could see them in a different setting and offer my honest opinion.\n\nI'm currently discussing city gallery opportunities with Maya, trying to understand their requirements and how her art fits in. I want to support her aspirations while balancing my own boat-building ambitions. My immediate goal is to review her art pieces at my workshop tomorrow and provide feedback. I'm also trying to grasp the city gallery's needs and expectations. I'm engaged in a conversation with Maya, and we're planning to meet at my workshop tomorrow to discuss further. I aim to be a supportive partner while also nurturing my own business goals in this coastal town.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah are no longer at his workshop, having concluded their discussion on Maya's art pieces and the city gallery's requirements. Maya's art pieces remain at Elijah's workshop, awaiting his feedback. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky. Chrys is no longer visible in the immediate vicinity, having completed the discussion on the gallery concept with Maya. \n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Maya, Chrys and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, creative, and ambitious, with a deeper understanding of her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and excited to nurture her artistic growth, while also being introspective about balancing his boat-building ambitions with her aspirations. Recently, they've strengthened their bond through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Elijah is making an effort to understand Maya's restlessness, rooting deeper into their life together. Their relationship is characterized by Elijah's steady nature and Maya's ambition, with ongoing dynamics of mutual understanding and enthusiasm. Maya's interests and passions have become more integrated into Elijah's life, and he is committed to supporting her artistic growth.\n\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\nElijah says: What's this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They're interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I'd love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I'm thinking they're looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don't you think? I'd love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I'd love to take a closer look at the pieces you're considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful. Elijah feels frustrated and concerned about Maya's discontent, while Maya feels trapped and uncertain. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah's steadfastness clashes with Maya's ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya's desires, yearning for more than stability. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah's exasperation growing and Maya's restlessness intensifying.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I'm Elijah, a boat builder rooted in this coastal town, with a deepening connection to Maya. I see myself as steady, reliable, and genuinely invested in our shared life. I've grown more confident in sharing my vision with Maya, and I'm heartened by her interest. I feel a stronger sense of unity, understanding her ambitions better. I'm excited to build a life together, balancing my boat-building legacy with nurturing Maya's artistic aspirations. Recent conversations have brought us closer, with Maya showing appreciation for my desires and me for her artistic dreams. Our connection feels stronger, with increased mutual understanding of our goals. I'm comfortable with my nature, feeling more aligned with Maya's aspirations, and I'm eager to continue supporting her artistic journey while growing my boat-building business.\n\n...How can I best support Maya's aspirations with the city gallery while balancing my own boat-building ambitions?...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\npreconditions - Near Maya and Gallery\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: Following goal has been satisfied.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act.

I wanted to understand their needs and expectations, so we could move forward with her art pieces. After our conversation, I suggested we review her art pieces at the workshop to get a better sense of what the gallery was looking for. We walked over to the workshop, and as we stood among her artwork, I gave her my thoughts on the pieces. She listened intently, and I could tell she appreciated my feedback. With the city gallery's requirements better understood, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Now, as I stand here with Maya in the workshop, I feel grateful to be near her and to have a better understanding of her aspirations. I'm thinking about how I can support her while also growing my boat-building business, and I wonder if sharing my vision with her will help us find a way to balance our ambitions.\n\nI'm currently in the workshop with Maya, having just reviewed her art pieces and discussed the city gallery's requirements. My immediate goal is to support Maya's aspirations while balancing my own ambitions for my boat-building business. I'm focused on understanding how to anchor our shared future in this harbor. I'm near Maya and the workshop, which is where I want to be. I'm also trying to provide feedback on her art pieces, although I haven't given it yet. I'm with Maya, and we're in the midst of a discussion about her art and our future together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day's work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah's wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah are in his workshop, having concluded their discussion on Maya's art pieces and the city gallery's requirements. Maya's art pieces remain at Elijah's workshop. Chrys is in the vicinity of the workshop. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T18:44:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Workshop terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, creative, and ambitious, with a deeper understanding of her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and excited to nurture her artistic growth. Currently, Elijah is introspective and contemplative, balancing his boat-building ambitions with Maya's aspirations. Their relationship has strengthened through open discussions, fostering empathy and cooperation. Recent interactions have increased Elijah's understanding of Maya's restlessness and ambitions. Ongoing dynamics of mutual understanding and enthusiasm continue, with Elijah making an effort to appreciate Maya's artistic passions.\n\nElijah says: Let's walk over, I'm curious. Your work and Chrys's, I'm eager to see.\nElijah says: What's this city gallery interested in, Maya? You seemed really excited about the letter.\nMaya says: They're interested in showcasing local artists, and I think my coastal series could be a great fit. I'd love to share some pieces with them. What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I'm thinking they're looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don't you think? I'd love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I'd love to take a closer look at the pieces you're considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\n\nChrys:\n Elijah views Chrys as an enigmatic outsider with unclear intentions, sparking curiosity and wariness. He's increasingly cautious and protective, especially around Maya. Recent encounters heightened his unease, fueling uncertainty about Chrys' influence on Maya and the town. Elijah remains open to understanding Chrys' impact but prioritizes his connection to Maya.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life, and feels trapped and uncertain. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful, and feels frustrated and concerned about her discontent. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah's steadfastness clashes with Maya's ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya's desires, yearning for more than stability, and his exasperation is growing. Maya's restlessness intensifies, feeling Elijah's lack of support. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah's directness now laced with hurt and Maya's ambitions fuelling her discontent.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I'm Elijah, a steadfast boat builder rooted in this coastal town, feeling more grounded with Maya by my side. I see myself as reliable and genuinely invested in our shared life, with a deeper understanding of Maya's artistic aspirations. Recent conversations have brought us closer, as I've shared my boat-building vision with her, and she's shown interest. I feel comfortable with my nature, aligned with Maya's aspirations, but still seeking to balance stability with nurturing her dreams. Our connection feels stronger, with increased mutual understanding of our goals, though some aspects of her ambitions remain unclear to me.\n\n...How can I best support Maya's aspirations with the city gallery while balancing my own boat-building ambitions?...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\npreconditions - Near Maya and Gallery\npreconditions - Near Maya and Workshop\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; characters: Maya distance 0\n#view North: visibility 3, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 13, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 9, terrain Harbor, slope Level ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 27, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n#view South: visibility 1, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility No clear visibility, terrain None; \n#view West: visibility No clear visibility, terrain None; \n#view Northwest: visibility No clear visibility, terrain None; \n\nvisual: You see Maya: 'Workshop#1'\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; characters: Maya distance 0\n#view North: visibility 4, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 13, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 8, terrain Harbor, slope Level ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 25, terrain Workshop, slope Level ; \n#view South: visibility 11, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 8, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view West: visibility 1, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 6, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; characters: Chrys distance 2\n\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Workshop; \n#view North: visibility 5, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 13, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 7, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 23, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 9, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 11, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view West: visibility 2, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 7, terrain Downtown, slope Level ; characters: Maya distance 2\n\ninternal: Maya's art pieces reviewed, but feedback not given; discussion concluded, with city gallery requirements better understood.\n\ninternal: Following task has been satisfied.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Finalize Art Piece Selection: Review and agree on specific art pieces with Maya, ensuring they align with gallery vision, while being open and enthusiastic.\n   Reason: Secure art that fits gallery focus.\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Maya confirms art piece selection \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

I showed her around the gallery, explaining my concept of showcasing rugged coastal mystique, and she seemed intrigued. Elijah, who was accompanying her, caught my eye, but I pushed the distraction aside, focusing on Maya. We discussed the possibilities of her showcasing her work, and she agreed to share some art pieces. I was thrilled, thinking I had secured her talent. But then, we stepped out of the gallery, and I realized we weren\'t done yet - details were still pending.\n\nI\'m currently discussing art and gallery opportunities with Maya, trying to finalize the details of showcasing her coastal landscape pieces at my gallery. My immediate goal is to secure her art talent and finalize the showcase. I\'m also intrigued by Elijah, who I met during the interview, but that\'s not my current focus. I\'m driven to build my gallery into a major art destination and I believe Maya\'s art fits perfectly with my vision. I\'m being assertive and pushy to ensure we move forward with the showcase, and I need to confirm the details with her soon.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah are in his workshop, having concluded their discussion on Maya\'s art pieces and the city gallery\'s requirements. Maya\'s art pieces remain at Elijah\'s workshop. Chrys is in the vicinity of the workshop. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T18:44:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Maya, Elijah and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Chrys views Maya as a talented and genuinely passionate artist, perceiving her as open and interested in collaborating. Chrys feels optimistic and excited, with a sense of 80% progress in securing a partnership, but also slightly possessive and eager to finalize the collaboration. Recent changes include Maya providing specific art piece suggestions, indicating increased engagement. Ongoing dynamics involve Chrys pushing to move forward, while Maya remains receptive but cautious, with Chrys\'s assertive tone potentially influencing Maya\'s careful consideration. Chrys\'s emotional state is driven and hopeful.\n\nMaya says: I\'ve fallen in love with it, the way the light dances over the harbor, the smell of saltwater and wood... it\'s inspiring. Your gallery could showcase that beauty.\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\nChrys says: Alright, let\'s finalize the art piece selection! What are your top three pieces that you think would fit perfectly with my gallery\'s rugged coastal vibe, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'ve been thinking about that, and I think "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" would be perfect for your gallery. They capture the essence of our coast\'s rugged beauty and the emotional connection I feel to this place. I can already imagine them on your walls, bringing the outdoors in.\n\nElijah:\n Chrys views Elijah as charming, well-connected, and intriguing with a hint of mystery. She feels optimistic, professionally curious, and slightly attracted to him. Recently, their tentative rapport has been reaffirmed as Chrys casually approached him and Maya, building conversation naturally. Their dynamic remains professional with a subtle undercurrent of attraction, as Chrys seeks to leverage their connection for her career while navigating her interest in Elijah amidst her ambitions. Chrys is eager to deepen their connection, sensing potential benefits for her art gallery and personal aspirations. Elijah\'s presence continues to captivate her, leaving her wanting to learn more about him.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Chrys views Maya as a charming and cooperative mediator, and Elijah as intriguing and charismatic. She\'s excited and cautiously optimistic about collaborating with Maya, feeling driven to secure the partnership for her gallery. Chrys is drawn to Elijah\'s enthusiasm, her assertive tone persisting as she explores connections. Recently, she\'s become more invested in working with Maya, while being attracted to Elijah\'s passion. Maya and Elijah appear close, standing together outside the gallery, sparking Chrys\'s interest.\n\n\n\nChrys:\n I\'m a driven and ambitious art gallery owner, confident in my vision, with a growing awareness of the need to balance assertiveness with relatability. I\'m comfortable with my nature, but increasingly self-aware, recognizing that building genuine connections with artists like Maya is key to my success. I\'ve made progress in refining my approach, achieving 80% success with Maya, and I\'m excited to further discuss opportunities. My conversation with Elijah has added a new dynamic, and I\'m considering how to thoughtfully integrate my goals with a more nuanced approach. I\'m embracing a more creative vision for my gallery, focusing on coastal landscapes and abstracts that capture the essence of the coast.\n\n...What are the key elements of my gallery vision that would resonate most with Maya, and how can I tailor my pitch to address...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nPersuade Maya to Accept Position - Convince Maya to join my gallery\nSecure Maya\'s Art Talent - Finalize gallery showcase for Maya\'s art pieces\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: Maya and Chrys partially discussed gallery vision, reviewing coastal landscape concept, with Maya showing interest and agreeing to share art pieces.\n\ninternal: Following task has been satisfied.

What are your top three pieces that you think would fit perfectly with my gallery\'s rugged coastal vibe, Maya?\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Controlling (directing, managing others)\n##\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nMaya\nMaya\nMaya\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Finalize Art Piece Selection: Review and agree on specific art pieces with Maya, ensuring they align with gallery vision, while being open and enthusiastic.\n   Reason: Secure art that fits gallery focus.\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Now;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Maya confirms art piece selection \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Elijah, the intriguing stranger I\'d met earlier, stood nearby, listening in on our conversation. I approached Maya, eager to finalize the art piece selection for my gallery. "Alright, let\'s finalize the art piece selection! What are your top three pieces that you think would fit perfectly with my gallery\'s rugged coastal vibe, Maya?" I asked, trying to keep the conversation focused. Maya thought for a moment before responding with "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge." I loved her choices and we began discussing how to display them. As we chatted, Maya revealed a letter from another city gallery, and Elijah showed interest, which caught my attention. I made a mental note to follow up on that later. For now, I was satisfied that Maya had agreed to showcase her art at my gallery.\n\nI\'m currently discussing art piece selection with Maya at Workshop#1, aiming to finalize a gallery showcase for her art. I\'m trying to secure her talent for my gallery, focusing on the \'rugged coastal\' theme. Elijah, an intriguing person I met earlier, is also present. My immediate goal is to convince Maya to showcase her art, specifically "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge." I\'m also considering Elijah\'s potential interest in my gallery. The conversation with Maya is ongoing, and I\'m pushing to move forward with the showcase plans.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah are in his workshop, having concluded their discussion on Maya\'s art pieces and the city gallery\'s requirements. Maya\'s art pieces remain at Elijah\'s workshop. Chrys is in the vicinity of the workshop. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T18:52:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Maya, Elijah and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Chrys views Maya as a talented, passionate, and like-minded artist, perceiving her as a great fit for her gallery. Chrys feels optimistic, excited, and slightly possessive towards Maya, with a sense of progress in securing a partnership. Recently, Maya has shown genuine interest in Chrys\'s gallery vision, and they\'ve made progress in discussing art piece selection, with Maya suggesting "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge." Ongoing dynamics involve Chrys pushing to move forward with the collaboration, while Maya remains receptive but cautious, influenced by Chrys\'s assertive tone. Their relationship has become more collaborative, with a sense of mutual enthusiasm for showcasing coastal landscapes.\n\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\nChrys says: Alright, let\'s finalize the art piece selection! What are your top three pieces that you think would fit perfectly with my gallery\'s rugged coastal vibe, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'ve been thinking about that, and I think "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" would be perfect for your gallery. They capture the essence of our coast\'s rugged beauty and the emotional connection I feel to this place. I can already imagine them on your walls, bringing the outdoors in.\nChrys says: I love those choices, can we discuss how to display them in a way that really brings out the rugged coastal vibe?\n\nElijah:\n Chrys views Elijah as charming, well-connected, and intriguing with a hint of mystery. She feels optimistic, professionally curious, and slightly attracted to him. Their tentative rapport has been reaffirmed through casual conversations, maintaining a professional dynamic with a subtle undercurrent of attraction. Recently, Chrys noticed Elijah\'s interest in Maya\'s gallery response, sparking her interest in leveraging their connection. Their relationship remains a balance of career ambitions and blossoming personal interest.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Chrys views Maya as charming and cooperative, and Elijah as intriguing and charismatic.

Chrys is drawn to Elijah\'s enthusiasm, sensing a potential connection. She perceives Maya as a valuable opportunity and Elijah as a captivating individual, with her interest in working with Maya and attraction to Elijah intensifying.\n\n\n\nChrys:\n I\'m Chrys, a driven and ambitious art gallery owner, refining my assertive approach to build genuine connections with artists. I\'ve found a sweet spot, balancing confidence with relatability, and recent conversations with Maya have yielded 80% success. Meeting Elijah has added a new dynamic, and I\'m embracing a creative vision for my gallery showcasing coastal landscapes and abstracts. I\'m comfortable with my nature, feeling more self-assured and open to thoughtful collaboration.

What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah.

I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place.

Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for!

Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration?

What do you think, should I take some of my favorites to show them?\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah.

She feels positive, appreciative, and inspired, with a deepening sense of collaboration. Their recent discussions about art piece selection and gallery showcase plans have strengthened their partnership, building trust and enthusiasm. The dynamic remains harmonious, with mutual respect and creative momentum, as Chrys\'s thoughtful feedback makes Maya feel seen and valued. With Chrys\'s guidance, Maya is excited to explore new opportunities, including a potential showcase with Elijah\'s support.\n\nChrys says: Exactly! I\'d love to showcase that here. Can I take you to my gallery to discuss further?\nChrys says: So, what kind of art are you into, Maya? I\'m always looking for new inspiration for my gallery.\nMaya says: I\'m really drawn to capturing light and movement, like the way the sunset dances on the water. I\'ve been experimenting with coastal landscapes and abstract pieces that evoke a sense of freedom. Your gallery sounds like the perfect platform to share that with the community.\nChrys says: That\'s exactly what I\'m looking for! Coastal landscapes, abstracts that capture the essence of this place... I can already see it on my gallery walls. Would you be open to showing some of your work at my gallery, or even doing a live demonstration? I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase.

She feels a calm, gentle warmth, now tinged with contemplation and deepening emotional resonance. Recent visual encounters have infused their serene connection with new brushstrokes, quietly intensifying their soothing melody. As she continues to unravel his mysteries, her thoughtful consideration and peaceful harmony with him evolve, drawing her closer to the depths of his character.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving\'s Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\nExplore Elijah\'s Career Possibilities - Show Elijah various career paths and opportunities\npreconditions - Evening discussion setting\nReconcile Love and Ambition - Balance personal relationships with artistic aspirations\nHonor All Parts of Herself - Integrate artistic aspirations with personal relationships and community connections.\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: Following task has been satisfied.

I decided to reach out to Elijah, a friend and potential mentor, to discuss my art and seek his feedback. We had a conversation about the city gallery\'s interests in local artists, and I shared my thoughts on authenticity and connection to our coastal town. Elijah expressed interest in seeing my work, particularly my coastal series, and invited me to bring some pieces to his workshop the next day.\n\nFeeling excited and vulnerable, I prepared some of my art pieces for the workshop. Elijah and I made plans for a feedback session, which I hoped would help me integrate my artistic aspirations with our personal connection. I also touched base with Chrys about potential gallery opportunities, and we discussed plans for an art showcase.\n\nThe past few hours have been fulfilling. I shared my art pieces with Elijah at his workshop, and he provided constructive feedback. With his insights, I feel more aligned with my artistic goals and personal relationships. A sense of emotional harmony has settled in, as I\'ve honored all parts of myself and reconciled my love and ambition. Elijah and Chrys are now just a short distance away, and I\'m grateful for their presence in my life.\n\nMaya is currently preparing to discuss her art pieces with Elijah at his workshop tomorrow, having already shared some of them with him. Her immediate goal is to receive constructive feedback from Elijah, which will help her integrate her artistic aspirations with her personal relationships and community connections. This aligns with her drives to Honor All Parts of Herself and Reconcile Love and Ambition. She is also nurturing her connection with Elijah, seeking his support and insights. With emotional harmony partially achieved, Maya is focused on deepening her relationships and artistic expression.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya and Elijah are in his workshop, having concluded their discussion on Maya\'s art pieces and the city gallery\'s requirements. Maya\'s art pieces remain at Elijah\'s workshop. Chrys is in the vicinity of the workshop. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T18:52:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain.

We walked over to the workshop, and as we stood among her artwork, I gave her my thoughts on the pieces. She listened intently, and I could tell she appreciated my feedback. With the city gallery\'s requirements better understood, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Now, as I stand here with Maya in the workshop, I feel grateful to be near her and to have a better understanding of her aspirations. I\'m thinking about how I can support her while also growing my boat-building business, and I wonder if sharing my vision with her will help us find a way to balance our ambitions.\n\nI\'m currently in the workshop with Maya, having just reviewed her art pieces and discussed the city gallery\'s requirements. My immediate goal is to support Maya\'s aspirations while balancing my own ambitions for my boat-building business. I\'m focused on understanding how to anchor our shared future in this harbor. I\'m near Maya and the workshop, which is where I want to be. I\'m also trying to provide feedback on her art pieces, although I haven\'t given it yet. I\'m with Maya, and we\'re in the midst of a discussion about her art and our future together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon.

The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding.

You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, ambitious, and passionate about her art, with a deepening appreciation for her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and committed to balancing his boat-building ambitions with her artistic goals. Recent interactions have strengthened their mutual understanding, fostering empathy and cooperation, with 80% mutual understanding and enthusiasm. Elijah is introspective, making an effort to connect his ambitions with Maya\'s aspirations, and values their shared future in the coastal town.\n\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\n\nChrys:\n Maya sees Elijah as steady and reliable, but slightly out of touch with her artistic ambitions. Elijah views Maya as creative and driven, but also increasingly distant. He feels a deep affection for her, but growing frustration with her enthusiasm for Chrys\'s vision. Recent discussions about the city gallery have introduced tension, making Elijah more protective and cautious. Maya\'s eagerness to explore Chrys\'s notes has Elijah feeling uneasy, sensing a potential threat to their connection and his boat-building business. Their relationship remains loving, but uncertainty and wariness have created a rift. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s aspirations, and Maya seeks to balance her art with the gallery\'s expectations.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life, and feels trapped and uncertain. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful, and feels frustrated and concerned about her discontent. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah\'s steadfastness clashes with Maya\'s ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s desires, yearning for more than stability, and his exasperation is growing. Maya\'s restlessness intensifies, feeling Elijah\'s lack of support. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah\'s directness now laced with hurt and Maya\'s ambitions fuelling her discontent.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I\'m Elijah, a steadfast boat builder rooted in this coastal town, feeling more grounded with Maya by my side. I see myself as reliable and genuinely invested in our shared life, supportive of Maya\'s artistic aspirations and my own ambitions. Recent conversations have brought us closer, as I\'ve shared my boat-building vision with her, and she\'s shown interest. I feel comfortable with my nature, aligned with Maya\'s aspirations, though some aspects of her ambitions remain unclear.

I wanted to understand their needs and expectations, so we could move forward with her art pieces. After our conversation, I suggested we review her art pieces at the workshop to get a better sense of what the gallery was looking for. We walked over to the workshop, and as we stood among her artwork, I gave her my thoughts on the pieces. She listened intently, and I could tell she appreciated my feedback. With the city gallery\'s requirements better understood, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Now, as I stand here with Maya in the workshop, I feel grateful to be near her and to have a better understanding of her aspirations. I\'m thinking about how I can support her while also growing my boat-building business, and I wonder if sharing my vision with her will help us find a way to balance our ambitions.\n\nI\'m currently in the workshop with Maya, having just reviewed her art pieces and discussed the city gallery\'s requirements. My immediate goal is to support Maya\'s aspirations while balancing my own ambitions for my boat-building business. I\'m focused on understanding how to anchor our shared future in this harbor. I\'m near Maya and the workshop, which is where I want to be. I\'m also trying to provide feedback on her art pieces, although I haven\'t given it yet. I\'m with Maya, and we\'re in the midst of a discussion about her art and our future together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are in or near Elijah\'s workshop, discussing art pieces and their display, with a clearer understanding of the city gallery\'s expectations and the selection of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:00:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Downtown terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, ambitious, and passionate about her art, with a deepening appreciation for her aspirations. He feels supportive, affectionate, and committed to balancing his boat-building ambitions with her artistic goals. Recent interactions have strengthened their mutual understanding, fostering empathy and cooperation, with 80% mutual understanding and enthusiasm. Elijah is introspective, making an effort to connect his ambitions with Maya\'s aspirations, and values their shared future in the coastal town.\n\nElijah says: That sounds like a great opportunity. What do you need from me to make it happen?\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\n\nChrys:\n Maya sees Elijah as steady and reliable, but slightly out of touch with her artistic ambitions. Elijah views Maya as creative and driven, but also increasingly distant. He feels a deep affection for her, but growing frustration with her enthusiasm for Chrys\'s vision. Recent discussions about the city gallery have introduced tension, making Elijah more protective and cautious. Maya\'s eagerness to explore Chrys\'s notes has Elijah feeling uneasy, sensing a potential threat to their connection and his boat-building business. Their relationship remains loving, but uncertainty and wariness have created a rift. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s aspirations, and Maya seeks to balance her art with the gallery\'s expectations.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life, and feels trapped and uncertain. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful, and feels frustrated and concerned about her discontent. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah\'s steadfastness clashes with Maya\'s ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s desires, yearning for more than stability, and his exasperation is growing. Maya\'s restlessness intensifies, feeling Elijah\'s lack of support. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah\'s directness now laced with hurt and Maya\'s ambitions fuelling her discontent.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I\'m Elijah, a steadfast boat builder rooted in this coastal town, feeling more grounded with Maya by my side. I see myself as reliable and genuinely invested in our shared life, supportive of Maya\'s artistic aspirations and my own ambitions. Recent conversations have brought us closer, as I\'ve shared my boat-building vision with her, and she\'s shown interest. I feel comfortable with my nature, aligned with Maya\'s aspirations, though some aspects of her ambitions remain unclear. I\'m balancing stability with nurturing her dreams, and our connection feels stronger with increased mutual understanding of our goals.\n\n...How can I best support Maya\'s aspirations with the city gallery while balancing my own boat-building ambitions?...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\npreconditions - Near Maya and Gallery\npreconditions - Near Maya and Workshop\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; characters: Maya distance 0\n#view North: visibility 4, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 13, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 8, terrain Harbor, slope Level ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 25, terrain Workshop, slope Level ; \n#view South: visibility 11, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 8, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view West: visibility 1, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 6, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; characters: Chrys distance 2\n\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Workshop; \n#view North: visibility 5, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 13, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 7, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 23, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 9, terrain Harbor, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 11, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view West: visibility 2, terrain Garden, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 7, terrain Downtown, slope Level ; characters: Maya distance 2\n\ninternal: Maya\'s art pieces reviewed, but feedback not given; discussion concluded, with city gallery requirements better understood.\n\ninternal: Following task has been satisfied.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

I\'d love to discuss the possibilities.\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\nChrys says: Alright, let\'s finalize the art piece selection! What are your top three pieces that you think would fit perfectly with my gallery\'s rugged coastal vibe, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'ve been thinking about that, and I think "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" would be perfect for your gallery. They capture the essence of our coast\'s rugged beauty and the emotional connection I feel to this place. I can already imagine them on your walls, bringing the outdoors in.\nChrys says: I love those choices, can we discuss how to display them in a way that really brings out the rugged coastal vibe?\n\nElijah:\n Chrys views Elijah as charming, well-connected, and intriguing with a hint of mystery. She feels optimistic, professionally curious, and slightly attracted to him. Recently, she\'s noticed his interest in Maya\'s gallery response, sparking her interest in leveraging their connection. Their relationship remains a balance of career ambitions and blossoming personal interest, with Chrys eager to explore potential collaborations and possibilities with Elijah, while navigating her attraction to him.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Chrys views Maya as charming and cooperative, and Elijah as intriguing and charismatic. She\'s excited and cautiously optimistic about collaborating with Maya, feeling driven to secure the partnership. Recently, noticing Maya and Elijah\'s closeness has sparked Chrys\'s interest and fueled her assertive pursuit of their collaboration. Chrys is drawn to Elijah\'s enthusiasm, sensing a potential connection.\n\n\n\nChrys:\n I\'m Chrys, a driven and ambitious art gallery owner, confidently refining my assertive approach to attract top coastal artists. I\'ve found a sweet spot, balancing confidence with relatability, and recent conversations with Maya have yielded significant success. I\'m embracing a creative vision for my gallery, feeling more self-assured and open to thoughtful collaboration. Meeting Elijah has added a new dynamic, but my focus remains on showcasing emerging coastal artists. I\'m comfortable with my nature, merging my goals with an empathetic style, driving my gallery\'s growth as a premier showcase. My confidence and vision are aligning, propelling my gallery forward.\n\n...What are the key elements of my gallery vision that would resonate most with Maya, and how can I tailor my pitch to address...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nPersuade Maya to Accept Position - Convince Maya to join my gallery\nSecure Maya\'s Art Talent - Finalize gallery showcase for Maya\'s art pieces\npreconditions - Current Discussion Ongoing\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; characters: Maya distance 0, Elijah distance 0\n#view North: visibility 3, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 13, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 9, terrain Harbor, slope Level ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 27, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n#view South: visibility 1, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility No clear visibility, terrain None; \n#view West: visibility No clear visibility, terrain None; \n#view Northwest: visibility No clear visibility, terrain None; \n\nvisual: You see Maya: \'Workshop#1\'\nvisual: You see Elijah: \'Workshop#1\'\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Chrys says: Alright, let\'s finalize the art piece selection!

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Finalize Art Piece Selection: Discuss and agree on art display\n   Reason: Secure business arrangement with Maya\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: 19:05;  Duration: 0:30:00\n    Termination Criterion: Art piece selection confirmed with Maya \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening.

The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town.

You see  and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as a supportive and understanding partner who genuinely appreciates her artistic vision. She feels valued, grateful, and emotionally secure, with a deepening sense of trust. Currently, she\'s contemplative and calm, excited about their artistic discussions and plans. Recently, their relationship has become more collaborative, with Elijah\'s constructive feedback nurturing her growth. Their dynamic is characterized by interdependence, mutual support, and ongoing creative dialogue, with Elijah\'s thoughtful suggestions making Maya feel seen and appreciated.\n\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\nElijah says: "Maya, I love the way you capture the light in \'Tidal Shift.\' Can we play with the composition of \'Coastal Whispers\' to make it more dynamic?"\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a supportive and invested mentor, whose thoughtful feedback and guidance make her feel valued and inspired. She currently feels positive, appreciative, and enthusiastic about their collaboration, with a deepening sense of mutual respect. Their recent discussions have strengthened their partnership, fostering harmony and cooperation as they work together to align their creative goals, with no recent changes, but an ongoing dynamic of trust and enthusiasm that continues to grow.\n\nMaya says: "Chrys, I\'d love to hear more about your vision for the gallery showcase. What kind of art are you thinking of featuring, and how can I contribute?"\nChrys says: Alright, let\'s finalize the art piece selection! What are your top three pieces that you think would fit perfectly with my gallery\'s rugged coastal vibe, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'ve been thinking about that, and I think "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" would be perfect for your gallery. They capture the essence of our coast\'s rugged beauty and the emotional connection I feel to this place. I can already imagine them on your walls, bringing the outdoors in.\nChrys says: I love those choices, can we discuss how to display them in a way that really brings out the rugged coastal vibe?\nChrys says: So, how do you envision the layout of the gallery, and where would you like to see your pieces displayed?\nMaya says: I\'d love to see "Tidal Shift" as a centerpiece, with "Coastal Whispers" and "Horizon\'s Edge" flanking it. The way the light falls in the gallery could really make the colors pop. What do you think?\nChrys says: I love that idea, let\'s make it happen. I can totally see how the lighting would enhance the colors. Elijah, what do you think? Should we plan a site visit to the gallery to visualize the layout?\nMaya says: That sounds like a great plan, a site visit would really help us visualize the space. When were you thinking of scheduling it? I\'d love to get Elijah\'s input on the layout too.\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya views Elijah as an increasingly nuanced and enigmatic individual, with layers unfolding like a canvas, sparking growing curiosity and interest. She feels a calm, gentle warmth, now tinged with contemplation and deepening emotional resonance.

The way the light falls in the gallery could really make the colors pop. What do you think?\nChrys says: I love that idea, let\'s make it happen. I can totally see how the lighting would enhance the colors. Elijah, what do you think? Should we plan a site visit to the gallery to visualize the layout?\nMaya says: That sounds like a great plan, a site visit would really help us visualize the space. When were you thinking of scheduling it? I\'d love to get Elijah\'s input on the layout too.\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Harbor; \n#view North: visibility 20, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 31, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view East: visibility 4, terrain Garden, slope Level ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 32, terrain Garden, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 7, terrain Road, slope Uphill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 10, terrain Road, slope Uphill ; \n#view West: visibility 2, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 22, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n\n##\n\n#Recent history\n\n##\n\n#Previous act if any\n\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Connecting (building/strengthening relationships)\n##\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nElijah\nElijah\nElijah\nChrys\nGallery#1\nChrys\nTools#1\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Finalize Art Piece Layout: Discuss and agree on gallery layout with Chrys and Elijah, ensuring art pieces are displayed to maximize impact while reflecting coastal vibe.\n   Reason: Align art display with gallery vision.\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Chrys\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: 19:30;  Duration: 0:45:00\n    Termination Criterion: Art piece layout is agreed upon \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are in or near Elijah\'s workshop, having finalized the selection of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display at the city gallery, with plans for a site visit to finalize the layout. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:13:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see  and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nElijah:\n Maya views Elijah as a supportive and understanding partner who genuinely appreciates her artistic vision. She feels valued, grateful, and emotionally secure, with a deepening sense of trust. Currently, she\'s contemplative and calm, excited about their artistic discussions and plans. Recently, their relationship has become more collaborative, with Elijah\'s constructive feedback nurturing her growth. Their dynamic is characterized by interdependence, mutual support, and ongoing creative dialogue, with Elijah\'s thoughtful suggestions making Maya feel seen and appreciated.\n\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\nElijah says: "Maya, I love the way you capture the light in \'Tidal Shift.\' Can we play with the composition of \'Coastal Whispers\' to make it more dynamic?"\n\nChrys:\n Maya views Chrys as a supportive and invested mentor, whose thoughtful feedback and guidance make her feel valued and inspired. She currently feels positive, appreciative, and enthusiastic about their collaboration, with a deepening sense of mutual respect. Their recent discussions have strengthened their partnership, fostering harmony and cooperation as they work together to align their creative goals. The relationship remains stable with no recent changes, but an ongoing dynamic of trust and enthusiasm continues to grow.\n\nMaya says: I\'ve been thinking about that, and I think "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" would be perfect for your gallery. They capture the essence of our coast\'s rugged beauty and the emotional connection I feel to this place. I can already imagine them on your walls, bringing the outdoors in.\nChrys says: I love those choices, can we discuss how to display them in a way that really brings out the rugged coastal vibe?\nChrys says: So, how do you envision the layout of the gallery, and where would you like to see your pieces displayed?\nMaya says: I\'d love to see "Tidal Shift" as a centerpiece, with "Coastal Whispers" and "Horizon\'s Edge" flanking it. The way the light falls in the gallery could really make the colors pop. What do you think?\nChrys says: I love that idea, let\'s make it happen. I can totally see how the lighting would enhance the colors. Elijah, what do you think? Should we plan a site visit to the gallery to visualize the layout?\nMaya says: That sounds like a great plan, a site visit would really help us visualize the space. When were you thinking of scheduling it? I\'d love to get Elijah\'s input on the layout too.\nMaya says: Let\'s walk over to the gallery and visualize the layout with Chrys and Elijah, we can discuss the flow and how the pieces will interact with the space.\nChrys says: I\'m so down, let\'s do this! Shall we grab some flashlights or headlights to illuminate the space, don\'t want to miss any details. Elijah, you in?\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya views Elijah as an increasingly nuanced and enigmatic individual, with layers unfolding like a canvas, sparking growing curiosity and interest. She feels a calm, gentle warmth, now tinged with contemplation and deepening emotional resonance. Recent visual encounters have infused their serene connection with new brushstrokes, quietly intensifying their soothing melody. As she continues to unravel his mysteries, her thoughtful consideration and peaceful harmony with him evolve, drawing her closer to the depths of his character.\n\n\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\nShare News with Elijah - Inform Elijah about gallery offer letter\nAssess Leaving\'s Impact on Community Ties - Evaluate effects of leaving on local connections and relationships\nExplore Elijah\'s Career Possibilities - Show Elijah various career paths and opportunities\npreconditions - Evening discussion setting\nReconcile Love and Ambition - Balance personal relationships with artistic aspirations\nHonor All Parts of Herself - Integrate artistic aspirations with personal relationships and community connections.\nCommit to Path Forward - Determine clear next steps for art and relationships\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: Elijah\'s feedback on Maya\'s art pieces partially reviewed, with constructive insights considered, but not fully documented. \n\ninternal: Following task has been satisfied.

Elijah, you in?\n##\n\n#Recent history\n\n##\n\n#Previous act if any\nSay Let\'s walk over to the gallery and visualize the layout with Chrys and Elijah, we can discuss the flow and how the pieces will interact with the space.\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Connecting (building/strengthening relationships)\n##\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nElijah\nElijah\nElijah\nChrys\nGallery#1\nChrys\nTools#1\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Finalize Art Piece Layout: Discuss and agree on gallery layout with Chrys and Elijah, ensuring art pieces are displayed to maximize impact while reflecting coastal vibe.\n   Reason: Align art display with gallery vision.\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Chrys\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: 19:30;  Duration: 0:45:00\n    Termination Criterion: Art piece layout is agreed upon \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

As I walked in, Maya was already there, surrounded by her paintings. I gave her my honest thoughts on her work, suggesting we focus on a few pieces to tweak for the gallery\'s style while staying true to her art. She appreciated my input, and we started discussing Chrys\'s notes to get a better sense of the gallery\'s vision.\n\nAs we talked, I couldn\'t help but think about my own ambitions - growing my boat-building business while supporting Maya\'s art. I wanted to make sure my business was rooted in this town, just like my family\'s legacy. Maya asked me about my goals, and I shared my vision of building something that lasts, bringing people together. \n\nWe decided on three pieces to display at the gallery, and I helped Maya think about how to make one of her pieces, \'Coastal Whispers,\' more dynamic. With her vision aligning with mine, I felt a sense of balance and harmony. Being near Maya and the workshop, surrounded by her art and the smell of wood, felt like exactly where I was meant to be.\n\nI\'m currently in the downtown area with Maya, discussing her art and our shared future. We\'ve been reviewing her art pieces, and I\'ve been offering feedback to help her align with the city gallery\'s expectations. My immediate goal is to continue supporting Maya\'s artistic vision while growing my boat-building business. I want to find a balance between our ambitions and ensure our visions align. I\'m actively engaged in conversation with Maya, exploring ways to merge our goals and create a lasting impact in this coastal town. Our discussion is focused on nurturing each other\'s passions and securing our shared future.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon.

Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are in or near Elijah\'s workshop, having finalized the selection of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display at the city gallery, with plans for a site visit to finalize the layout. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:13:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, artistic, and ambitious, with a deepening connection. He feels affectionate, committed, and enthusiastic about their shared future. Recent discussions have strengthened mutual understanding, achieving 80% enthusiasm for each other\'s goals. Maya\'s art pieces have been reviewed, and Elijah provided constructive feedback, bringing them closer to a shared vision. Their relationship is characterized by steady communication, growing trust, and a balance of stability and creative freedom, as they navigate supporting each other\'s passions and ambitions. Elijah is supportive of Maya\'s artistic vision, and Maya appreciates Elijah\'s steady and reliable nature.\n\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\nElijah says: "Maya, I love the way you capture the light in \'Tidal Shift.\' Can we play with the composition of \'Coastal Whispers\' to make it more dynamic?"\n\nChrys:\n Maya sees Elijah as steady and reliable, but somewhat limited in his understanding of her artistic ambitions. Elijah perceives Maya as driven and restless, with a frustrating lack of appreciation for the stability he offers. Currently, Elijah feels slightly insecure and threatened by Maya\'s enthusiasm for Chrys\'s vision, sensing a challenge to their connection and his business. Recently, their conversation has shown a glimmer of collaboration and compromise, as Elijah tries to understand and support Maya\'s artistic goals. However, tensions and misunderstandings linger, with Elijah struggling to fully grasp Maya\'s aspirations and Maya seeking external validation.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life, and feels trapped and uncertain. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful, and feels frustrated and concerned about her discontent. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah\'s steadfastness clashes with Maya\'s ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s desires, yearning for more than stability, and his exasperation is growing. Maya\'s restlessness intensifies, feeling Elijah\'s lack of support. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah\'s directness now laced with hurt and Maya\'s ambitions fuelling her discontent.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I\'m Elijah, a boat builder with deep roots in this coastal town, feeling grounded in my connection to Maya, my craft, and our shared life. I\'m supportive and invested in nurturing her artistic ambitions, while also driven to expand my business and create a lasting legacy here. I\'ve made progress in understanding her restlessness, but sometimes still feel frustrated by her lack of appreciation for our stable life. Recent conversations with Maya have helped me better align my vision with her artistic goals, and I\'m growing more comfortable with balancing stability and nurturing her dreams. I\'m becoming more empathetic and collaborative, seeking to deepen our mutual understanding.\n\n...How can I best support Maya\'s aspirations with the city gallery while balancing my own boat-building ambitions?...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\npreconditions - Near Maya and Gallery\npreconditions - Near Maya and Workshop\nBalance Ambitions and Embrace Change - Support Maya\'s art while growing boat-building business\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; characters: Maya distance 0\n#view North: visibility 2, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 14, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view East: visibility 8, terrain Road, slope Level ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 31, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 5, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 24, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view West: visibility 8, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 13, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Maya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for.

As I walked in, Maya was already there, surrounded by her paintings. I gave her my honest thoughts on her work, suggesting we focus on a few pieces to tweak for the gallery\'s style while staying true to her art. She appreciated my input, and we started discussing Chrys\'s notes to get a better sense of the gallery\'s vision.\n\nAs we talked, I couldn\'t help but think about my own ambitions - growing my boat-building business while supporting Maya\'s art. I wanted to make sure my business was rooted in this town, just like my family\'s legacy. Maya asked me about my goals, and I shared my vision of building something that lasts, bringing people together. \n\nWe decided on three pieces to display at the gallery, and I helped Maya think about how to make one of her pieces, \'Coastal Whispers,\' more dynamic. With her vision aligning with mine, I felt a sense of balance and harmony. Being near Maya and the workshop, surrounded by her art and the smell of wood, felt like exactly where I was meant to be.\n\nI\'m currently in the downtown area with Maya, discussing her art and our shared future. We\'ve been reviewing her art pieces, and I\'ve been offering feedback to help her align with the city gallery\'s expectations. My immediate goal is to continue supporting Maya\'s artistic vision while growing my boat-building business. I want to find a balance between our ambitions and ensure our visions align. I\'m actively engaged in conversation with Maya, exploring ways to merge our goals and create a lasting impact in this coastal town. Our discussion is focused on nurturing each other\'s passions and securing our shared future.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are in or near Elijah\'s workshop, having finalized the selection of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display at the city gallery, with plans for a site visit to finalize the layout. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:13:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, artistic, and ambitious, with a deepening connection. He feels affectionate, committed, and enthusiastic about their shared future. Recent discussions have strengthened mutual understanding, achieving 80% enthusiasm for each other\'s goals. Maya\'s art pieces have been reviewed, and Elijah provided constructive feedback, bringing them closer to a shared vision. Their relationship is characterized by steady communication, growing trust, and a balance of stability and creative freedom, as they navigate supporting each other\'s passions and ambitions. Elijah is supportive of Maya\'s artistic vision, and Maya appreciates Elijah\'s steady and reliable nature.\n\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\nElijah says: "Maya, I love the way you capture the light in \'Tidal Shift.\' Can we play with the composition of \'Coastal Whispers\' to make it more dynamic?"\n\nChrys:\n Maya sees Elijah as steady and reliable, but somewhat limited in his understanding of her artistic ambitions. Elijah perceives Maya as driven and restless, with a frustrating lack of appreciation for the stability he offers. Currently, Elijah feels slightly insecure and threatened by Maya\'s enthusiasm for Chrys\'s vision, sensing a challenge to their connection and his business. Recently, their conversation has shown a glimmer of collaboration and compromise, as Elijah tries to understand and support Maya\'s artistic goals. However, tensions and misunderstandings linger, with Elijah struggling to fully grasp Maya\'s aspirations and Maya seeking external validation.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life, and feels trapped and uncertain. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful, and feels frustrated and concerned about her discontent. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah\'s steadfastness clashes with Maya\'s ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s desires, yearning for more than stability, and his exasperation is growing. Maya\'s restlessness intensifies, feeling Elijah\'s lack of support. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah\'s directness now laced with hurt and Maya\'s ambitions fuelling her discontent.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I\'m Elijah, a boat builder with deep roots in this coastal town, feeling grounded in my connection to Maya, my craft, and our shared life. I\'m supportive and invested in nurturing her artistic ambitions, while also driven to expand my business and create a lasting legacy here. I\'ve made progress in understanding her restlessness, but sometimes still feel frustrated by her lack of appreciation for our stable life. Recent conversations with Maya have helped me better align my vision with her artistic goals, and I\'m growing more comfortable with balancing stability and nurturing her dreams. I\'m becoming more empathetic and collaborative, seeking to deepen our mutual understanding.\n\n...How can I best support Maya\'s aspirations with the city gallery while balancing my own boat-building ambitions?...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\npreconditions - Near Maya and Gallery\npreconditions - Near Maya and Workshop\nBalance Ambitions and Embrace Change - Support Maya\'s art while growing boat-building business\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nvisual: #view Current: visibility 0, terrain Downtown; characters: Maya distance 0\n#view North: visibility 2, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n#view Northeast: visibility 14, terrain Harbor, slope Uphill ; \n#view East: visibility 8, terrain Road, slope Level ; \n#view Southeast: visibility 31, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view South: visibility 5, terrain Road, slope Downhill ; \n#view Southwest: visibility 24, terrain Workshop, slope Downhill ; \n#view West: visibility 8, terrain Downtown, slope Downhill ; \n#view Northwest: visibility 13, terrain Downtown, slope Uphill ; \n\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Maya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

As I walked in, Maya was already there, surrounded by her paintings. I gave her my honest thoughts on her work, suggesting we focus on a few pieces to tweak for the gallery\'s style while staying true to her art. She appreciated my input, and we started discussing Chrys\'s notes to get a better sense of the gallery\'s vision.\n\nAs we talked, I couldn\'t help but think about my own ambitions - growing my boat-building business while supporting Maya\'s art. I wanted to make sure my business was rooted in this town, just like my family\'s legacy. Maya asked me about my goals, and I shared my vision of building something that lasts, bringing people together. \n\nWe decided on three pieces to display at the gallery, and I helped Maya think about how to make one of her pieces, \'Coastal Whispers,\' more dynamic. With her vision aligning with mine, I felt a sense of balance and harmony. Being near Maya and the workshop, surrounded by her art and the smell of wood, felt like exactly where I was meant to be.\n\nI\'m currently in the downtown area with Maya, discussing her art and our shared future. We\'ve been reviewing her art pieces, and I\'ve been offering feedback to help her align with the city gallery\'s expectations. My immediate goal is to continue supporting Maya\'s artistic vision while growing my boat-building business. I want to find a balance between our ambitions and ensure our visions align. I\'m actively engaged in conversation with Maya, exploring ways to merge our goals and create a lasting impact in this coastal town. Our discussion is focused on nurturing each other\'s passions and securing our shared future.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are in or near Elijah\'s workshop, having finalized the selection of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display at the city gallery, with plans for a site visit to finalize the layout. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:13:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, artistic, and ambitious, with a deepening connection. He feels affectionate, supportive, and enthusiastic about their shared future. Recent discussions have strengthened mutual understanding, achieving 80% enthusiasm for each other\'s goals. Maya\'s art pieces have been reviewed, and Elijah provided constructive feedback, bringing them closer to a shared vision. Elijah is supportive of Maya\'s artistic vision, and Maya appreciates Elijah\'s steady and reliable nature. Their relationship is characterized by steady communication, growing trust, and a balance of stability and creative freedom.\n\nElijah says: What do you think the city gallery is looking for in local artists, Maya?\nMaya says: I\'m thinking they\'re looking for authenticity, Elijah. A genuine connection to this place and its stories. My coastal series feels like a good fit, don\'t you think? I\'d love to get your honest opinion on some of the pieces.\nElijah says: I think your coastal series captures the heart of this place. I\'d love to take a closer look at the pieces you\'re considering. Can I see them at my workshop tomorrow?\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\nElijah says: "Maya, I love the way you capture the light in \'Tidal Shift.\' Can we play with the composition of \'Coastal Whispers\' to make it more dynamic?"\n\nChrys:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven and talented but restless and hard to understand. He feels slightly insecure and threatened by her enthusiasm for Chrys\'s vision. Currently, Elijah is trying to support Maya\'s artistic goals, feeling a glimmer of collaboration and compromise. He is cautiously optimistic about their relationship, struggling to balance his desire for stability with Maya\'s need for creative freedom. Recent conversations have shown a tentative truce, but tensions linger. Elijah wants to root himself firmly in the community and prove his worth as a partner.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life, and feels trapped and uncertain. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful, and feels frustrated and concerned about her discontent. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah\'s steadfastness clashes with Maya\'s ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s desires, yearning for more than stability, and his exasperation is growing. Maya\'s restlessness intensifies, feeling Elijah\'s lack of support. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah\'s directness now laced with hurt and Maya\'s ambitions fuelling her discontent.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I\'m Elijah, a boat builder with deep roots in this coastal town, growing more attuned to Maya\'s artistic vision and my own ambitions. I\'m finding a sense of balance between stability and growth, and becoming more supportive of Maya\'s passions. My connection to this community and Maya remains strong, but I\'m navigating the nuances of partnership and local entrepreneurship. I\'ve become more adaptable, seeking common ground, and learning to appreciate Maya\'s restlessness as a catalyst for growth. I\'m confident in my craft and my relationship, with a clearer sense of how to merge my business goals with Maya\'s needs.\n\n...How can I best support Maya\'s aspirations with the city gallery while balancing my own boat-building ambitions?...\n...What are the key points in Chrys\'s notes that we need to focus on to align Maya\'s art with the gallery\'s vision?...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\npreconditions - Near Maya and Gallery\npreconditions - Near Maya and Workshop\nBalance Ambitions and Embrace Change - Support Maya\'s art while growing boat-building business\n##\n\n#Recent memories\nauditory: Conversation with Maya:\n Maya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Elijah, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Review Gallery Requirements: Review Chrys\'s notes with Maya to understand gallery expectations and provide feedback on art pieces.\n   Reason: Understand gallery\'s vision for Maya\'s art.\n   Actors: [\'Elijah\', \'Maya\', \'Chrys\']\n    Start time: 19:15;  Duration: 0:30:00\n    Termination Criterion: Chrys\'s notes reviewed and discussed with Maya \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

We sat down together, and I asked to take a glance at the notes, wanting to ensure we\'re on the same page. Maya handed them over, and we highlighted the key points, focusing on the gallery\'s preference for a cohesive flow. This conversation sparked a deeper discussion about her art and my own ambitions for my boat-building business. I wanted to support her creative vision while growing my business, which I believed would anchor our shared future.\n\nAs we talked, Maya mentioned her desire to evoke a sense of connection and belonging through her art, which resonated with my own goals for my boats. I realized that my goal to balance my ambitions and support Maya\'s art was slowly taking shape. With Chrys\'s notes reviewed and discussed, I felt a sense of accomplishment, knowing we\'re moving forward together. Maya and I were currently in her downtown studio, surrounded by her art pieces, some of which would soon be displayed at the city gallery. I was proud of how far we\'ve come, and I looked forward to continuing to nurture her passions and grow my craft, side by side.\n\nI\'m currently with Maya in Downtown, having just reviewed Chrys\'s notes on the city gallery\'s requirements for her art. We discussed how to align her pieces with the gallery\'s vision. My immediate goal is to support Maya\'s art while growing my boat-building business, ensuring our shared future is secure. I aim to balance my ambitions with embracing change. I\'m actively nurturing Maya\'s passions and working on mastering my craft. Our conversation has brought us closer, and I\'m focused on being a reliable partner as we navigate our goals together.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are now near Maya Downtown, having moved from the harbor, with flashlights in hand, preparing to head to the city gallery to visualize the layout of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:31:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain. You see Maya and  resources\n##\n                      \n#Known other actors \nMaya:\n Elijah sees Maya as driven, artistic, and ambitious, with a deepening understanding of her restless nature. He feels supportive, invested, and hopeful about their shared future. Recently, they\'ve collaborated closely on Maya\'s art, finding common ground and balance between stability and creative freedom. Elijah is proud of their progress, feeling grateful for Maya\'s passion and creativity. Their relationship remains steady, with growing trust, mutual support, and a deepening connection, as they navigate Maya\'s artistic goals and Elijah\'s boat-building ambitions. Elijah is committed to nurturing Maya\'s passions while anchoring their shared future.\n\nMaya says: That sounds perfect, Elijah. I can bring some pieces to your workshop tomorrow afternoon. I\'d love to hear your thoughts on them in a different setting, surrounded by your beautiful woodwork.\nMaya says: What are your thoughts on how I can balance my artistic vision with the city gallery\'s expectations?\nElijah says: Honestly, I think you\'ve got a great vision, but we need to see what the gallery\'s looking for. Maybe we can pick a few pieces to focus on, and I can help you tweak them to fit their style while still staying true to your art.\nMaya says: I\'d love to hear more about what you think the gallery\'s looking for. Can we take a look at Chrys\'s notes or something? That way, we can get a better sense of their vision.\nElijah says: "Maya, I love the way you capture the light in \'Tidal Shift.\' Can we play with the composition of \'Coastal Whispers\' to make it more dynamic?"\nElijah says: Hey, do you have Chrys\'s notes on the city gallery\'s requirements? I think it would help us finalize the art pieces.\nMaya says: I\'ve got them right here, let me check. I think Chrys mentioned something about the gallery\'s preference for a cohesive flow. We should probably review it together to ensure we\'re on the same page.\nElijah says: Alright, let\'s take a look. I\'m curious to see what Chrys had to say. Can I take a glance at the notes? Maybe we can highlight the key points together.\n\nChrys:\n Maya sees Elijah as steady and supportive, but sometimes limited in his understanding of her artistic ambitions. Elijah views Maya as driven, talented, and restless. He\'s cautiously optimistic, working to balance stability with her creative freedom. Recently, they\'ve made progress in understanding each other\'s needs, reviewing Chrys\'s notes on the city gallery\'s requirements. Elijah feels collaborative and invested in Maya\'s artistic goals, while Maya appreciates his effort to appreciate her ambitions. Their relationship is evolving, with Elijah seeking to root himself firmly in the community and prove his worth as a partner. Tensions linger, but they\'re working together to align Maya\'s vision with the gallery\'s expectations.\n\n\n\nMaya, elijah:\n Maya sees Elijah as dependable but stifling, craving excitement beyond their tranquil life, and feels trapped and uncertain. Elijah views Maya as driven yet ungrateful, and feels frustrated and concerned about her discontent. Recent interactions reveal deepening tension as Elijah\'s steadfastness clashes with Maya\'s ambitions. Elijah struggles to understand Maya\'s desires, yearning for more than stability, and his exasperation is growing. Maya\'s restlessness intensifies, feeling Elijah\'s lack of support. Their strained relationship shows no signs of easing, with Elijah\'s directness now laced with hurt and Maya\'s ambitions fuelling her discontent.\n\n\n\nElijah:\n I\'m Elijah, a hands-on boat builder, supportive partner, and collaborative problem solver. I\'m comfortable with my straightforward nature, using it to work with Maya on her art and my business. I feel more confident in balancing my ambitions with nurturing Maya\'s vision, and our partnership is stronger as we work together in the workshop. I\'m proud to be anchoring Maya\'s heart here, and our shared growth is taking shape. I\'m finding my place in this coastal town, and I\'m excited to see our life and business flourish together, with a deepening sense of local roots and connection.\n\n...How can I best support Maya\'s aspirations with the city gallery while balancing my own boat-building ambitions?...\n...What are the key points in Chrys\'s notes that we need to focus on to align Maya\'s art with the gallery\'s vision?...\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nShare Future Vision with Maya - Show Maya a future in town\npreconditions - Evening Harbor Setting\nSupport Maya at Gallery - Accompany Maya to assess gallery world\npreconditions - Near Maya and Gallery\npreconditions - Near Maya and Workshop\nBalance Ambitions and Embrace Change - Support Maya\'s art while growing boat-building business\npreconditions - Near Maya Downtown\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: Following goal has been satisfied.

I loved her choices and we started brainstorming how to display them. As we talked, Maya pulled out a letter from her pocket, revealing a response from a city gallery, and Elijah, who was standing nearby, showed interest. I quickly shifted gears, asking her to elaborate on her vision for the layout. She suggested a centerpiece with "Tidal Shift" and flanking pieces, which I enthusiastically agreed to. Elijah chimed in, and we decided on a site visit to visualize the layout. With the art piece selection confirmed, I felt a sense of accomplishment. As we wrapped up, I glanced around, taking in our surroundings in the downtown area, and noticed Elijah standing nearby, his presence still lingering in my mind.\n\nI\'m currently discussing and finalizing a gallery showcase with Maya and Elijah, confirming art piece selection and planning a site visit to visualize the layout. My immediate goal is to secure a business arrangement with Maya, having already satisfied some preconditions. I\'m driven to build my career in the art world, capitalizing on the \'rugged coastal\' mystique. I\'m interacting with Maya and Elijah, having just discussed art display and planning a site visit. I aim to finalize the agreement and move forward with the showcase, leveraging Maya\'s talent and Elijah\'s potential interest.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are now near Maya Downtown, having moved from the harbor, with flashlights in hand, preparing to head to the city gallery to visualize the layout of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:31:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination?

I loved her choices and we started brainstorming how to display them. As we talked, Maya pulled out a letter from her pocket, revealing a response from a city gallery, and Elijah, who was standing nearby, showed interest. I quickly shifted gears, asking her to elaborate on her vision for the layout. She suggested a centerpiece with "Tidal Shift" and flanking pieces, which I enthusiastically agreed to. Elijah chimed in, and we decided on a site visit to visualize the layout. With the art piece selection confirmed, I felt a sense of accomplishment. As we wrapped up, I glanced around, taking in our surroundings in the downtown area, and noticed Elijah standing nearby, his presence still lingering in my mind.\n\nI\'m currently discussing and finalizing a gallery showcase with Maya and Elijah, confirming art piece selection and planning a site visit to visualize the layout. My immediate goal is to secure a business arrangement with Maya, having already satisfied some preconditions. I\'m driven to build my career in the art world, capitalizing on the \'rugged coastal\' mystique. I\'m interacting with Maya and Elijah, having just discussed art display and planning a site visit. I aim to finalize the agreement and move forward with the showcase, leveraging Maya\'s talent and Elijah\'s potential interest.\n##\n\nYour current situation is:\n\n#Situation \n\nA small coastal town at dusk, where the river meets the sea, with the sun having dipped below the horizon. Colorful buildings line the waterfront, with artists\' workshops and fishing boats creating a scene of rustic charm. The evening light casts long shadows as townspeople finish their day\'s work. The sky transitions from a soft pink to a deep blue, with stars twinkling in the night sky.\n\nThe calm weather remains, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of the town. Elijah\'s wooden boat, moored in the harbor, bobs gently on the water, its hull reflecting the fading light. The air is filled with the scent of salt water and wood. Birds call as they return to roost for the evening. Maya, Elijah, and Chrys are now near Maya Downtown, having moved from the harbor, with flashlights in hand, preparing to head to the city gallery to visualize the layout of "Tidal Shift," "Coastal Whispers," and "Horizon\'s Edge" for display. The town takes on a peaceful evening ambiance, with evening routines unfolding. The stars are becoming more visible in the night sky, and the current time is 2025-04-13T19:31:14.625542.\n\n##\n\n#Surroundings \nYou are in Harbor terrain.

I can totally see how the lighting would enhance the colors. Elijah, what do you think? Should we plan a site visit to the gallery to visualize the layout?\nMaya says: That sounds like a great plan, a site visit would really help us visualize the space.

Maya, you said you wanted to see the layout with \'Tidal Shift\' as the centerpiece, right?"\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Controlling (directing, managing others)\n##\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nMaya\nMaya\nMaya\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Chrys, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Visualize Gallery Layout: Walk to gallery with Maya and Elijah to visualize layout, ensuring optimal display of art pieces, while showcasing enthusiasm and confidence.\n   Reason: Secure business arrangement with Maya through collaborative visualization.\n   Actors: [\'Chrys\', \'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: 19:32;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Agreement on gallery layout reached with Maya and Elijah. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]
