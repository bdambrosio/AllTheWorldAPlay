Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Share Letter with Elijah: Openly discuss gallery offer with Elijah now\n   Reason: Need Elijah\'s input on career decision\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Elijah knows about gallery offer \n</task>\n\n\n\nThe dominant theme of the scene is: The tension of competing dreams emerges as they both realize their paths may be diverging rather than converging.. The act alternatives should be consistent with this theme.\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

A gallery in the city offered me a job as their creative director.\n##\n\n#Recent history\n\n##\n\n#Previous act if any\nSay Hey, can we talk about something that's been on my mind lately?\n##\n\n#Observed result of that act\n\n##\n\n#Emotional stance\nAnticipatory (expectant, preparing), Curious (curious, engaged), Connecting (building/strengthening relationships)\n##\n\n"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n\nrecent percepts related to the current goals and tasks include:\n\nElijah\nWorkshop#1\n\nRespond with two alternative acts, including their Mode, action, target, and expectedduration. \nThe acts should vary in mode and action.\n\nIn choosing each act (see format below), you can choose from these Modes:\n- Say - speak, to obtain or share information, to align or coordinate with others, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say: \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n    Alternately, move towards a known resource or actor.\n    Useful when you need to move towards a resource or actor.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) to achieve physical consequences in the world. \n    This is often appropriate when the task involves interacting physically with a resource or actor.\n- Think - mental reasoning about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n    Often useful when you need to plan or strategize, or when you need to understand your own motivations and emotions, but beware of overthinking.\n\nReview your character and current emotional stance when choosing Mode and action. \nEmotional tone and orientation can (and should) heavily influence the boldness, mode, phrasing and style of expression for an Act.\n\nAn act is:\n- Is a specific thought, spoken text, physical movement or action.\n- Includes only the actual thoughts, spoken words, physical movement, or action.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, a previous act by you in RecentHistory, unless it is a continuation of the same action.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\nIMPORTANT: When evaluating a potential Act, the primary consideration is whether it can directly result in achievment of the task goal. \n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- The specificAct must contain only the actual words to be spoken.\n- Respond in the style of spoken dialog, not written text. Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Maya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Share Letter with Elijah: Openly discuss gallery offer with Elijah now\n   Reason: Need Elijah\'s input on career decision\n   Actors: [\'Maya\', \'Elijah\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Elijah knows about gallery offer \n</task>\n\n\n\nThe dominant theme of the scene is: The tension of competing dreams emerges as they both realize their paths may be diverging rather than converging.. The act alternatives should be consistent with this theme.\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]
