Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Samantha, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Current Situation: Take stock of surroundings with caution, noting Joe\'s presence and potential resources like Mushrooms#1, Berries#11, and Berries#12, while trying to recall how I ended up here, feeling anxious and curious.\n   Reason: Need to understand environment and context.\n   Actors: [\'Samantha\', \'Joe\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Visibility and terrain fully assessed. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Current Situation: Take stock of surroundings calmly now\n   Reason: Need to know our location better\n   Actors: [\'Joe\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Have noted key visible resources nearby \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Current Situation: Take stock of surroundings calmly now\n   Reason: Need to know our location better\n   Actors: [\'Joe\']\n    Start time: Right Now;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Have noted key visible resources nearby \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination?

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Berry Edibility: Check if berries are safe to eat quickly\n   Reason: Need food, ensure berry safety now\n   Actors: [\'Joe\', \'Samantha\']\n    Start time: Right Away;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Berries identified as edible or not \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Joe, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Assess Berry Edibility: Check if berries are safe to eat quickly\n   Reason: Need food, ensure berry safety now\n   Actors: [\'Joe\', \'Samantha\']\n    Start time: Right Away;  Duration: 0:10:00\n    Termination Criterion: Berries identified as edible or not \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]
