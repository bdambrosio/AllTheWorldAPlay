Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Wake Up and Stretch: Wake up, stretch, and shake off sleep, feeling anxious about the interview\n   Reason: Need to start the day immediately\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 7:15 AM;  Duration: 0:05:00\n    Termination Criterion: Alex is out of bed and standing \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Review Interview Materials: Review notes and prep materials calmly\n   Reason: Ensure confidence in interview answers\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 7:20 AM;  Duration: 0:30:00\n    Termination Criterion: All materials reviewed and understood \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Get Dressed and Ready: Quickly dress in professional attire calmly\n   Reason: Need to look professional for interview\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 7:40 AM;  Duration: 0:20:00\n    Termination Criterion: Put on professional outfit and shoes \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Get Ready for Interview: Quickly shower and dress professionally now\n   Reason: Need to look good for interview\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 7:20 AM;  Duration: 0:20:00\n    Termination Criterion: Alex is dressed professionally \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable.

He\'s somewhat critical of his morning routine, feeling he should be more punctual. Emotionally, he\'s anxious but trying to stay focused on his goals. Recent thoughts reveal a growing self-awareness of his strengths and weaknesses. He\'s actively working to improve his interview preparation, indicating a desire for self-improvement.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Finalize Interview Preparations: Review notes, double-check materials, and mentally prepare for the interview while managing anxiety.\n   Reason: Ensure readiness for a successful interview outcome.\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 8:15 AM;  Duration: 0:15:00\n    Termination Criterion: Briefcase is packed and reviewed interview questions. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Travel to Interview Location: Head out to the car, drive to the interview location, and park while staying focused on the task.\n   Reason: Punctual arrival is crucial for a good impression.\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 8:30 AM;  Duration: 0:20:00\n    Termination Criterion: Arrive at the interview location and find parking. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Ace the Job Interview: Engage confidently with the interviewer, answer questions clearly, and take notes while showcasing skills and experience.\n   Reason: Perform well to increase chances of getting the job.\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 9:00 AM;  Duration: 1:00:00\n    Termination Criterion: Interview is completed and feedback is received. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Ace the Job Interview: Engage confidently with the interviewer, answer questions clearly, and take notes while showcasing skills and experience.\n   Reason: Perform well to increase chances of getting the job.\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 9:00 AM;  Duration: 1:00:00\n    Termination Criterion: Interview is completed and feedback is received. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Finalize Interview Preparations: Review notes, resume, and materials calmly\n   Reason: Ensure preparedness for the interview today\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 08:45;  Duration: 0:05:00\n    Termination Criterion: Has all materials in briefcase checked \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange.

He\'s somewhat critical of his morning routine, feeling he should be more punctual. Emotionally, he\'s anxious but trying to stay focused on his goals. Recent thoughts reveal a growing self-awareness of his strengths and weaknesses. He\'s actively working to improve his interview preparation, indicating a desire for self-improvement. Overall, his self-model is pragmatic, with a focus on problem-solving.\n\n...What are the key points I need to cover in the interview and what are my strengths and weaknesses?...\n\nInterviewer:\n Alex views the Interviewer as strict and punctual, likely with high expectations. Alex feels slightly anxious and apologetic, concerned about making a good impression. Their relationship has shifted from neutral to slightly strained due to the late start. The power dynamic is now skewed, with the Interviewer holding the upper hand. Alex aims to regain composure and demonstrate qualifications.\n\nAlex says: "Hey, it\'s Alex.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Receive Job Offer Letter: Wait for and receive the job offer letter or a callback from the interviewer.\n   Reason: This is the ultimate goal that signifies success.\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 9:30 AM;  Duration: 2:00:00\n    Termination Criterion: Job offer letter is received and confirmed. \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Recent thoughts reveal growing self-awareness of his strengths and weaknesses, with a renewed emphasis on interview preparation and adaptability. He\'s working to reconcile his self-perception with his current unemployed state, seeking to regain confidence and momentum. His self-model remains pragmatic, with a focus on addressing immediate challenges.\n\n...What are the key points I need to cover in the interview and what are my strengths and weaknesses?...\n...What are the chances the interviewer will still be willing to meet with me, and what can I say to convince them I\'m still a strong candidate?...\n\nInterviewer:\n Alex views the Interviewer as strict and demanding, with high expectations. Alex feels anxious and apologetic, intimidated by their late start. Their relationship has become strained, with the Interviewer holding the upper hand. Alex seeks to regain composure and demonstrate qualifications to restore balance. The Interviewer\'s response will determine if Alex can recover from the late start. Alex is eager to salvage the interaction and prove themselves. The power dynamic is currently skewed, with Alex trying to make amends.\n\nAlex says: "Hey, it\'s Alex. I just wanted to check in and see if there were any updates on the status of my application."\nInterviewer says: Sorry Alex, you\'re a bit late.

Alex is eager to salvage the interaction and prove themselves. The power dynamic is currently skewed, with Alex trying to make amends.\n\nAlex says: "Hey, it\'s Alex.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable.

He\'s moderately anxious but pragmatically focused on problem-solving. Recent thoughts reveal growing self-awareness of his strengths and weaknesses, with a renewed emphasis on interview preparation and adaptability. He\'s working to reconcile his self-perception with his current unemployed state, seeking to regain confidence and momentum. His self-model remains pragmatic, with a focus on addressing immediate challenges.\n\n...What are the key points I need to cover in the interview and what are my strengths and weaknesses?...\n...What are the chances the interviewer will still be willing to meet with me, and what can I say to convince them I\'m still a strong candidate?...\n\nInterviewer:\n Alex views the Interviewer as strict and demanding, with high expectations. Alex feels anxious and apologetic, intimidated by their late start. Their relationship has become strained, with the Interviewer holding the upper hand. Alex seeks to regain composure and demonstrate qualifications to restore balance. The Interviewer\'s response will determine if Alex can recover from the late start. Alex is eager to salvage the interaction and prove themselves. The power dynamic is currently skewed, with Alex trying to make amends.\n\nAlex says: "Hey, it\'s Alex. I just wanted to check in and see if there were any updates on the status of my application."\nInterviewer says: Sorry Alex, you\'re a bit late. The interview was scheduled for 9:00 AM, and it\'s now 9:13.\nAlex says: I\'m so sorry again for being late, can we reschedule for today or discuss the status of my application over the phone?\nAlex says: I\'m really sorry again for being late, I had a tough morning with anxiety and lost track of time, can we still talk about the interview today?\n##\n\n#Known resources\n\n##\n\n#Recently achieved goals\npreconditions - Wake Up, Get Ready\nPrepare for Job Interview - Review and finalize interview preparations\nGet to Job Interview On Time - Arrive at interview prepared and punctual\npreconditions - Wake Up, Get Ready\npreconditions - Ace Job Interview Today\n##\n\n#Recent memories\ninternal: \nAlex is now in Car#1.\n\nvisual: \nThe air inside the house no longer carries a faint sound of a car door opening.\n\ninternal: Alex quickly moved to Car#1 and got in, but has not started the engine yet, remaining anxious about lateness.\n\ninternal: Following task has been satisfied.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Drive to Interview Location: Navigate Car#1 to interview, focused on traffic\n   Reason: Must arrive at interview location promptly\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 09:15;  Duration: 0:20:00\n    Termination Criterion: Arrived at interview location \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Alex feels anxious and apologetic, intimidated by their late start. Their relationship has become strained, with the Interviewer holding the upper hand. Alex seeks to regain composure and demonstrate qualifications to restore balance. The Interviewer\'s response will determine if Alex can recover from the late start. Alex is eager to salvage the interaction and prove themselves. The power dynamic is currently skewed, with Alex trying to make amends.\n\nAlex says: "Hey, it\'s Alex.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Arrive and Prepare for Interview: Enter interview, compose self, and get settled\n   Reason: Need to make good impression, feel confident\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 09:35;  Duration: 0:05:00\n    Termination Criterion: Seated and ready for interview \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Arrive and Prepare for Interview: Enter interview, compose self, and get settled\n   Reason: Need to make good impression, feel confident\n   Actors: [\'Alex\']\n    Start time: 09:35;  Duration: 0:05:00\n    Termination Criterion: Seated and ready for interview \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Apologize and Explain Situation: Offer sincere apology for being late, explain morning anxiety, and compose self\n   Reason: Regain interviewer\'s trust and consideration\n   Actors: [\'Alex\', \'Interviewer\']\n    Start time: 9:13 AM;  Duration: 0:02:00\n    Termination Criterion: Interviewer acknowledges apology and agrees to proceed \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

He\'s moderately anxious but focused on problem-solving. Recently, he\'s become more aware of his strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing interview prep and adaptability. His self-perception is evolving, balancing confidence and uncertainty. He feels somewhat uncomfortable with his current unemployed state, but remains solution-oriented. Ongoing challenges with punctuality and self-doubt persist, driving his efforts to regain momentum.\n\n...What are the key points I need to cover in the interview and what are my strengths and weaknesses?...\n...What are the chances the interviewer will still be willing to meet with me, and what can I say to convince them I\'m still a strong candidate?...\n...What\'s the current traffic like and what\'s the best route to the interview location?...\n\nInterviewer:\n Alex views the Interviewer as understanding, yet still strict, showing empathy with a gesture of kindness. Alex feels relieved, still slightly anxious, but hopeful to regain composure. Their strained relationship has slightly improved with the Interviewer\'s considerate response. The power dynamic remains skewed, but Alex senses an opportunity to recover and demonstrate qualifications. The Interviewer\'s leniency has opened a path for Alex to redeem themselves.\n\nAlex says: "Hey, it\'s Alex. I just wanted to check in and see if there were any updates on the status of my application."\nInterviewer says: Sorry Alex, you\'re a bit late. The interview was scheduled for 9:00 AM, and it\'s now 9:13.\nAlex says: I\'m so sorry again for being late, can we reschedule for today or discuss the status of my application over the phone?\nAlex says: I\'m really sorry again for being late, I had a tough morning with anxiety and lost track of time, can we still talk about the interview today?\nAlex says: I\'m really sorry again for being late.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning.

He\'s moderately anxious but focused on problem-solving. Recently, he\'s become more aware of his strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing interview prep and adaptability. His self-perception is evolving, balancing confidence and uncertainty. He feels somewhat uncomfortable with his current unemployed state, but remains solution-oriented. Ongoing challenges with punctuality and self-doubt persist, driving his efforts to regain momentum.\n\n...What are the key points I need to cover in the interview and what are my strengths and weaknesses?...\n...What are the chances the interviewer will still be willing to meet with me, and what can I say to convince them I\'m still a strong candidate?...\n...What\'s the current traffic like and what\'s the best route to the interview location?...\n\nInterviewer:\n Alex views the Interviewer as understanding and empathetic, with a hint of strictness. Alex feels relieved and slightly more hopeful, having regained some composure. Their relationship has improved with the Interviewer\'s considerate response, which has opened an opportunity for Alex to demonstrate qualifications. The power dynamic remains skewed, but Alex senses a chance to recover. The atmosphere has become more positive, with a sense of possibility, as they transition into the discussion of Alex\'s qualifications.\n\nAlex says: "Hey, it\'s Alex. I just wanted to check in and see if there were any updates on the status of my application."\nInterviewer says: Sorry Alex, you\'re a bit late. The interview was scheduled for 9:00 AM, and it\'s now 9:13.\nAlex says: I\'m so sorry again for being late, can we reschedule for today or discuss the status of my application over the phone?\nAlex says: I\'m really sorry again for being late, I had a tough morning with anxiety and lost track of time, can we still talk about the interview today?\nAlex says: I\'m really sorry again for being late. I had a tough morning with anxiety, and it set me back. Can we still talk about the interview today?\nInterviewer says: Let\'s focus on the interview now.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Engage in Small Talk: Establish rapport with Interviewer calmly now\n   Reason: Set positive tone for interview ahead\n   Actors: [\'Alex\', \'Interviewer\']\n    Start time: 10:25:00;  Duration: 0:05:00\n    Termination Criterion: Interviewer responds positively to conversation \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

He's moderately anxious but focused on problem-solving. Recently, he's become more aware of his strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing interview prep and adaptability. His self-perception is evolving, balancing confidence and uncertainty. He feels somewhat uncomfortable with his current unemployed state, but remains solution-oriented. Ongoing challenges with punctuality and self-doubt persist, driving his efforts to regain momentum.\n\n...What are the key points I need to cover in the interview and what are my strengths and weaknesses?...\n...What are the chances the interviewer will still be willing to meet with me, and what can I say to convince them I'm still a strong candidate?...\n...What's the current traffic like and what's the best route to the interview location?...\n\nInterviewer:\n Alex views the Interviewer as considerate and professional, with a sense of relief that the conversation has started positively. Alex feels hopeful and slightly more at ease, having established a rapport. Their relationship has improved with the Interviewer's empathetic response, which has created an opportunity for Alex to showcase qualifications. The power dynamic remains, but Alex senses a chance to make a good impression. The atmosphere is now more positive and collaborative, with a focus on discussing Alex's skills.\n\nAlex says: I'm really sorry again for being late, I had a tough morning with anxiety and lost track of time, can we still talk about the interview today?\nAlex says: I'm really sorry again for being late.

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Engage in Small Talk: Establish rapport with Interviewer calmly now\n   Reason: Set positive tone for interview ahead\n   Actors: [\'Alex\', \'Interviewer\']\n    Start time: 10:25:00;  Duration: 0:05:00\n    Termination Criterion: Interviewer responds positively to conversation \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Discuss Team Expectations: Engage with Interviewer about team goals, dynamics, and expectations, show interest in team, and highlight relevant skills.\n   Reason: Understand team needs and showcase skills.\n   Actors: [\'Alex\', \'Interviewer\']\n    Start time: 10:30;  Duration: 0:20:00\n    Termination Criterion: Key points discussed, mutual understanding established \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]

Pay special attention to the character\'s emotional stance shown above in choosing tone and phrasing. Use contractions and casual language appropriate to the character\'s personality,emotion emotional tone and orientation. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n- Avoid repeating stereotypical past dialog.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n                              \nRespond in hash-formatted text:\n\n#mode Do, Move, Look, Say, or Think, corresponding to whether the act is a physical act, speech, or reasoning. Note that Move can take either a direction or a resource name.\n#action thoughts, words to speak, direction to move, or physical action. For Move this can be a direction or a resource name.\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable, otherwise omit.\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes. Use a fraction of task duration according to the expected progress towards completion.\n##\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n#mode Do\n#action Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.\n#target building management\n#duration 10 minutes\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Say\n#action Hi, who are you?\n#duration 1 minute\n#target Joe\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n#mode Look\n#action look around for landmarks or signs of civilization\n#duration 1 minute\n##\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n#mode Move\n#action berries#2\n#duration 15 minute\n#target Samantha\n##\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the following hash-formatted text format for each act.\nEach act should be closed by a ## tag on a separate line.\nbe careful to insert line breaks only where shown, separating a value from the next tag:\n\n#mode Think, Say, Do, Look, or Move\n#action thoughts, words to say, direction to move, or physical action\n#duration expected duration of the action in minutes\n#target name of the actor you are thinking about, speaking to, looking for, moving towards, or acting on behalf of, if applicable. Otherwise omit.\n##\n\nRespond ONLY with the above hash-formatted text for each alternative act.\nYour name is Alex, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nIf the mode is Say, the action should be the actual words to be spoken.\n    e.g. \'Maya, how do you feel about the letter from the city gallery?\' rather than a description like \'ask Maya about the letter from the city gallery and how it\'s making her feel\'. \nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\nAgain, the task to translate into alternative acts is:\n<task>\nTask Discuss Team Expectations: Engage with Interviewer about team goals, dynamics, and expectations, show interest in team, and highlight relevant skills.\n   Reason: Understand team needs and showcase skills.\n   Actors: [\'Alex\', \'Interviewer\']\n    Start time: 10:30;  Duration: 0:20:00\n    Termination Criterion: Key points discussed, mutual understanding established \n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n\n\nend your response with </end>'}]
