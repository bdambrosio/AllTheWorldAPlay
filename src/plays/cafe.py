Daria has an arched eyebrow and slight smirk, while Victoria is checking her planner between

# Scenario notes:
# This simulation creates a space for exploring teenage life challenges through different perspectives:
# - Sage provides wisdom and philosophical insights
# - Luna represents emotional and artistic viewpoints
# - Emma offers emotional support and careful listening
# - Daria challenges assumptions and adds productive tension
# - Victoria brings achievement-oriented perspective and additional tension
#
# The human player (Player) can:
# 1. Seek advice about life situations
# 2. Observe different viewpoints clash and resolve
# 3. Practice navigating complex social dynamics
# 4. Explore different approaches to teenage challenges
#
# Example interactions:
# Player.inject("What do you think about choosing between following your passion and being practical?")
# Player.inject("How do you deal with pressure from parents about grades?")
# Player.inject("Is it weird that I sometimes feel like I'm pretending to be someone I'm not?")
