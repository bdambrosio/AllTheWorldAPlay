Furthermore, the evaluation of LLM-based CRS poses significant challenges, as traditional metrics may not be sufficient to capture their performance and effectiveness.

In conclusion, LLM-based conversational

Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have emerged as a promising approach to provide personalized recommendations through interactive conversations with users. However, current recommendation systems face several limitations and challenges. One major issue is the lack of sufficient contextual information to accurately understand user preferences. Conversations typically consist of a few sentences, making it difficult to capture the underlying semantics and intent behind user queries. Furthermore, there is a natural semantic gap between natural language expressions and item-level user preferences, which hinders the ability to provide accurate recommendations.

Another challenge is the need for seamless integration between the recommender component and the dialog component in CRS. The recommender component requires contextual information to learn user preferences, while the dialog component needs to generate informative responses to clarify user intents. Existing solutions, such as belief trackers and switching decoders, have improved the performance of CRS to some extent, but they still struggle to address the aforementioned issues.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in addressing these challenges. LLMs can be used to enhance the recommender component by providing a better understanding of user preferences and item attributes. They can also be employed to improve the dialog component by generating more informative and contextually relevant responses. Moreover, LLMs can facilitate the integration of knowledge graphs and other external knowledge sources to enhance the performance of CRS.
