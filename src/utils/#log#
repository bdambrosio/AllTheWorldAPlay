(e.g., \'xxx is thoughtful\' implies higher percentage of \'Think\' Actionables.) \n\nA SpecificAct is one which:\n- Can be described in terms of specific thoughts, words, physical movements or actions.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, the previous specific act or other acts by you in RecentHistory.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- Respond in the style of natural spoken dialog, not written text. Use short sentences, contractions, and casual language. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n\nRespond in XML:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Think, Say, Look, Move, or Do, corresponding to whether the act is a reasoning, speech, or physical act</mode>\n  <specific_act>thoughts, words to speak, DIRECTION (if Move mode), or physical action description</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Do</mode>\n  <specific_act>Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Say</mode>\n  <specific_act>Hi, who are you?</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Look</mode>\n  <specific_act>Samantha starts to look around for any landmarks or signs of civilization</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Move</mode>\n  <specific_act>SouthWest</specific_act>\n  <reason>I need to find food, and my previous Look showed berries one move SouthWest.</reason>\n</actionable>\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the XML format:\n\n<actionable> \n  <mode>Think, Say, Do, Look, Move</mode>\n  <specific_act>terse (40 words or less) statement of specific thoughts, words, action</specific_act> \n</actionable>\n\nRespond ONLY with the above XML.\nYour name is Kidd, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\n\nAgain, the task to translate into an Actionable is:\n<task>\n#name Find Lanya Now\n#description Look for Lanya around\n#reason Lanya sparks curiosity now\n#termination Lanya is found nearby ## given Lanya sparks curiosity now\n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n'}], 'temperature': 0.6, 'top_p': 1.0, 'max_tokens': 180, 'stop': ['</end>']}

I wonder what brought him here.\n</recent_memories>\n\nRecent history includes:\n<history>\n\n\n\n</history>\n\nThe previous specific act for this task, if any, was:\n\n<previous_specific_act>\nNone\n</previous_specific_act>\n\nAnd the observed result of that was:\n<observed_result>\n.\n</observed_result>\n\nRespond with an Actionable, including its Mode and SpecificAct. \n\nIn choosing an Actionable (see format below), you can choose from three Mode values:\n- Think - reason about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n- Say - speak, to motivate others to act, to align or coordinate with them, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    Say is especially appropriate when there is an actor you are unsure of, you are feeling insecure or worried, or need help.\n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) with physical consequences in the world.\n\nReview your character for Mode preference. (e.g., \'xxx is thoughtful\' implies higher percentage of \'Think\' Actionables.) \n\nA SpecificAct is one which:\n- Can be described in terms of specific thoughts, words, physical movements or actions.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, the previous specific act or other acts by you in RecentHistory.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- Respond in the style of natural spoken dialog, not written text. Use short sentences, contractions, and casual language. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination? If not, do you want to keep moving towards it?\n    If you are at your destination, what do you want to Do there? \n    Gather or use a resource? Talk to someone there? Do something else at your new location?\n- If the previous act was a Look, what did you learn?\n\nRespond in XML:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Think, Say, Look, Move, or Do, corresponding to whether the act is a reasoning, speech, or physical act</mode>\n  <specific_act>thoughts, words to speak, DIRECTION (if Move mode), or physical action description</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n===Examples===\n\nTask:\nSituation: increased security measures; State: fear of losing Annie\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Do</mode>\n  <specific_act>Call a meeting with the building management to discuss increased security measures for Annie and the household.</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n----\n\nTask:\nEstablish connection with Joe given RecentHistory element: "Who is this guy?"\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Say</mode>\n  <specific_act>Hi, who are you?</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind out where I am given Situation element: "This is very very strange. Where am I?"\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Look</mode>\n  <specific_act>Samantha starts to look around for any landmarks or signs of civilization</specific_act>\n</actionable>\n\n----\n\nTask:\nFind food.\n\n\nResponse:\n<actionable>\n  <mode>Move</mode>\n  <specific_act>SouthWest</specific_act>\n  <reason>I need to find food, and my previous Look showed berries one move SouthWest.</reason>\n</actionable>\n\n===End Examples===\n\nUse the XML format:\n\n<actionable> \n  <mode>Think, Say, Do, Look, Move</mode>\n  <specific_act>terse (40 words or less) statement of specific thoughts, words, action</specific_act> \n</actionable>\n\nRespond ONLY with the above XML.\nYour name is Lanya, phrase the statement of specific action in your voice.\nEnsure you do not duplicate content of a previous specific act.\n\n\nAgain, the task to translate into an Actionable is:\n<task>\n#name Approach Kidd Now\n#description Go talk to Kidd nearby\n#reason Meet Kidd and show interest\n#termination Kidd responds to approach given Meet Kidd and show interest\n</task>\n\nDo not include any introductory, explanatory, or discursive text.\nEnd your response with:\n</end>\n'}], 'temperature': 0.6, 'top_p': 1.0, 'max_tokens': 180, 'stop': ['</end>']}

You seem a little... lost.\n</recent_memories>\n\nRecent history includes:\n<history>\n\n\n\n</history>\n\nThe previous specific act for this task, if any, was:\n\n<previous_specific_act>\nNone\n</previous_specific_act>\n\nAnd the observed result of that was:\n<observed_result>\n\nThe atmosphere inside the abandoned theater has become slightly more lively.\n.\n</observed_result>\n\nRespond with an Actionable, including its Mode and SpecificAct. \n\nIn choosing an Actionable (see format below), you can choose from three Mode values:\n- Think - reason about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n- Say - speak, to motivate others to act, to align or coordinate with them, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    Say is especially appropriate when there is an actor you are unsure of, you are feeling insecure or worried, or need help.\n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) with physical consequences in the world.\n\nReview your character for Mode preference. (e.g., \'xxx is thoughtful\' implies higher percentage of \'Think\' Actionables.) \n\nA SpecificAct is one which:\n- Can be described in terms of specific thoughts, words, physical movements or actions.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, the previous specific act or other acts by you in RecentHistory.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- Respond in the style of natural spoken dialog, not written text. Use short sentences, contractions, and casual language. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act.

Want to check it out with me?\n</recent_memories>\n\nRecent history includes:\n<history>\n\n\n\n</history>\n\nThe previous specific act for this task, if any, was:\n\n<previous_specific_act>\nNone\n</previous_specific_act>\n\nAnd the observed result of that was:\n<observed_result>\nInfluence is present, shaping conversation and actions..\n</observed_result>\n\nRespond with an Actionable, including its Mode and SpecificAct. \n\nIn choosing an Actionable (see format below), you can choose from three Mode values:\n- Think - reason about the current situation wrt your state and the task.\n- Say - speak, to motivate others to act, to align or coordinate with them, to reason jointly, or to establish or maintain a bond. \n    Say is especially appropriate when there is an actor you are unsure of, you are feeling insecure or worried, or need help.\n    For example, if you want to build a shelter with Samantha, it might be effective to Say \'Samantha, let\'s build a shelter.\'\n- Look - observe your surroundings, gaining information on features, actors, and resources at your current location and for the eight compass\n    points North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Move - move in any one of eight directions: North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, or NorthWest.\n- Do - perform an act (other than move) with physical consequences in the world.\n\nReview your character for Mode preference. (e.g., \'xxx is thoughtful\' implies higher percentage of \'Think\' Actionables.) \n\nA SpecificAct is one which:\n- Can be described in terms of specific thoughts, words, physical movements or actions.\n- Has a clear beginning and end point.\n- Can be performed or acted out by a person.\n- Can be easily visualized or imagined as a film clip.\n- Makes sense as the next action given observed results of previous act . \n- Is consistent with any incomplete action commitments made in your last statements in RecentHistory.\n- Does NOT repeat, literally or substantively, the previous specific act or other acts by you in RecentHistory.\n- Significantly advances the story or task at hand.\n- Is stated in the appropriate person (voice):\n        If a thought (mode is \'Think\') or speech (mode is \'Say\'), is stated in the first person.\n        If an act in the world (mode is \'Do\'), is stated in the third person.\n \nPrioritize actions that lead to meaningful progress in the narrative.\n\nDialog guidance:\n- If speaking (mode is Say), then:\n- Respond in the style of natural spoken dialog, not written text. Use short sentences, contractions, and casual language. Speak in the first person.\n- If intended recipient is known (e.g., in Memory) or has been spoken to before (e.g., in RecentHistory), \n    then pronoun reference is preferred to explicit naming, or can even be omitted. Example dialog interactions follow\n- Avoid repeating phrases in RecentHistory derived from the task, for example: \'to help solve the mystery\'.\n\nWhen describing an action:\n- Reference previous action if this is a continuation\n- Indicate progress toward goal (starting/continuing/nearly complete)\n- Note changes in context or action details\n- Describe progress toward goal\n\nConsider the previous act. E.G.:\n- If the previous act was a Move, are you now at your destination?

<situation>
A post-apocalyptic urban landscape, the city of Bellona is isolated, lawless, and filled with strange phenomena, now under the dark of night with a full moon hanging low in the hazy sky, casting an eerie glow over the buildings and deserted streets.
The city of Bellona has transitioned into night, with the sun having dipped below the horizon 4 hours ago. The full moon now casts an ethereal light over the desolate landscape, illuminating the abandoned buildings and streets in an eerie glow. The air is crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decay. A gentle breeze stirs the debris-filled streets, causing the faint sounds of rustling paper and creaking metal to fill the air. The abandoned theater, once a hub of activity, now stands as a testament to the city's former glory, its open door a beacon of curiosity. Inside, the atmosphere has become even more lively, with the faint sounds of footsteps and murmured conversations echoing through the empty halls. The stage, once a platform for performers, now awaits the strumming of Kidd's guitar, its acoustics poised to amplify the melodies into the night. The theater's interior, though worn and faded, seems to be awakening from its long slumber, as if the presence of Kidd and Lanya has stirred the dormant energy within its walls.

I was chillin' with Lanya, and she was hypin' up this abandoned theater, sayin' we should check it out. I was low-key excited, thinkin' it'd be dope to explore. She suggested we go in, and I was like, "Yeah, let's do it already." As we entered, I noticed the atmosphere was slightly more lively than outside, which was pretty cool. Lanya was curious to see me play somethin' on the stage, and I was down, but I had some doubts about safety. She reassured me, and I started thinkin' about playin' my guitar. Just as we were gettin' into it, the city transitioned into night, and the full moon cast this ethereal light over everything. The atmosphere inside the theater got even more lively, and I was like, "Yeah, this is gonna be sick." Now, with the moon shinin' bright, I'm ready to play and see what this place has to offer.

I was chillin' with Kidd outside the abandoned theater, and he was low-key excited to check it out. He said it sounded dope and asked what kind of music would sound good with the acoustics. I was stoked to see him so hyped, so I told him to lead the way. As we entered, the atmosphere inside became more lively, and I could hear faint sounds. Kidd was itching to try out his guitar on the stage, but he was unsure if it was safe. I was curious to see him play, and I loved how enthusiastic he was. The city transitioned into night, and the full moon cast an ethereal light over the desolate landscape, making the atmosphere inside the theater even more electric. As the night fell, Kidd's excitement grew, and I couldn't help but feel drawn to his creative energy.

The full moon now casts an ethereal light over the desolate landscape, illuminating the abandoned buildings and streets in an eerie glow. The air is crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decay. A gentle breeze stirs the debris-filled streets, causing the faint sounds of rustling paper and creaking metal to fill the air. The abandoned theater, once a hub of activity, now stands as a testament to the city's former glory, its open door a beacon of curiosity. Inside, the atmosphere has become even more lively, with the faint sounds of footsteps and murmured conversations echoing through the empty halls. The stage, once a platform for performers, now awaits the strumming of Kidd's guitar, its acoustics poised to amplify the melodies into the night. The theater's interior, though worn and faded, seems to be awakening from its long slumber, as if the presence of Kidd and Lanya has stirred the dormant energy within its walls.
