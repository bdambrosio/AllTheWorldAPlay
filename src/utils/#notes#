'<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the most appropriate sensory mode for the message "You see Joe." Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the message is "You see Joe." The verb here is "see," which immediately makes me think of the visual sense. So, the sensory mode is likely visual. But I should double-check to make sure there\'s no other interpretation.\n\nThe input is a statement about perceiving someone, specifically seeing Joe. There\'s no mention'
