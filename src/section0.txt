Introduction
The field of conversational recommender systems (CRS) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to provide personalized recommendations to users through natural language conversations. CRS combines the capabilities of recommender systems and conversational AI to generate informative and engaging responses that take into account the user's preferences, context, and goals. The background and context of CRS are rooted in the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which often rely on explicit user feedback, such as ratings or clicks, to generate recommendations. However, in many cases, users may not provide explicit feedback, or their preferences may change over time, making it challenging for traditional systems to adapt.

The integration of conversational AI with recommender systems has led to the development of various CRS architectures, including those based on knowledge graphs, neural networks, and hybrid approaches. These systems aim to capture the nuances of human conversation and generate recommendations that are not only relevant but also engaging and informative. For instance, the use of self-attention mechanisms and graph neural networks has been explored to model the complex relationships between users, items, and contexts. Moreover, the incorporation of multimodal knowledge distillation has shown promise in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of CRS models.

Despite the advancements in CRS, several challenges persist, including the cold-start problem, where new users or items lack sufficient interaction history, and the hallucination problem, where generated responses may contain inaccurate or misleading information. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various evaluation metrics, such as recall, precision, and fluency, to assess the performance of CRS models. Additionally, the use of human evaluation and crowdsourcing has become increasingly popular to gather high-quality annotations and improve the reliability of evaluation results.

The context of CRS is also influenced by the growing availability of large-scale datasets and the increasing demand for personalized services. The development of datasets such as MIND, HM, and Bili has facilitated the training and evaluation of CRS models, while the emergence of new applications, such as voice assistants and
