"<Situation>  \nA dense forest at dusk, with towering pine trees casting long shadows over a muddy trail marked by fresh drag marks and scattered blood droplets. The air is damp, and a light drizzle falls, glistening on the foliage.  \n\nThe forest has transitioned from late afternoon to early evening, with the sun dipping below the horizon and the sky shifting to deep purples and grays. The temperature has dropped, and a cool breeze rustles the leaves, carrying the faint metallic scent of blood. The drizzle has intensified slightly, creating a mist that clings to the ground and obscures visibility beyond a few meters. The muddy trail, now slick with rain, shows fresh scuff marks and more blood droplets leading northeast, where the terrain slopes uphill. To the south, the trail descends into a darker, denser part of the forest, where shadows deepen and the undergrowth thickens.  \n\nThe drag marks appear fresher and more pronounced, suggesting recent activity. The blood droplets are brighter and more frequent, indicating a possible struggle or injury. The forest is eerily quiet, with only the sound of rain pattering on leaves and the occasional distant rustle of movement. The mist and fading light make it difficult to discern details, adding to the sense of unease. The characters' movements have left faint footprints in the mud, but these are quickly being washed away by the rain. The environment feels increasingly oppressive, with the forest closing in and the weather amplifying the tension.  \n\n"
